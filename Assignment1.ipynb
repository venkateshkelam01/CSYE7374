       " 'chinook winds, or simply chinooks, are two types of prevailing warm, generally westerly winds in western north america: coastal chinooks and interior chinooks. the coastal chinooks are persistent seasonal, wet, southwesterly winds blowing in from the ocean. the interior chinooks are occasional warm, dry föhn winds blowing down the eastern sides of interior mountain ranges. the coastal chinooks were the original term, used along the northwest coast, and the term in the interior of north america is later and derives from the coastal term. along the pacific northwest coast, where the name is pronounced (\\'chin\\'+\\'uk\\'), the name refers to wet, warm winds off the ocean from the southwest; this is the original use of the term. the coastal chinook winds deliver tremendous amounts of moisture both as rain along the coast and snow in the coastal mountains, that sustain the characteristic temperate rainforests and climate of the pacific northwest. in north american western interior, the same name is used for föhn winds, generally, where the canadian prairies and great plains lie immediately east of various interior mountain ranges. there the name is pronounced (\\'shin\\'+\\'uk\\'). the same warm, wet coastal winds can also become the warm föhn winds on the eastern sides of mountain ranges, after having lost their moisture on the western sides; however, due to expanded use of the term in the interior for any föhn wind, interior chinooks are not necessarily originally coastal chinooks. in the interior of north america, the blackfoot people call these winds the \"snow eater\"; however, the more commonly used term \"chinook\" originates from the name of the eponymous chinook people, who lived near the ocean, along the lower columbia river, where the term was first derived. the reference to \"a chinook\" wind or weather system originally meant, to euro-american settlers along the pacific northwest coast, a warming wind from the ocean blowing into the interior regions of the pacific northwest of the north america. a strong föhn wind can make snow one foot (30 cm) deep almost vanish in one day. the snow partly sublimates and partly melts and evaporates in the dry wind. chinook winds have been observed to raise winter temperature, often from below −20 °c (−4°f) to as high as 10-20°c (50-68°f) for a few hours or days, then temperatures plummet to their base levels. in the pacific northwest \"chinook\" is used for coastal chinook winds in british columbia, and is the original use of the term, being rooted in the lore of coastal natives and immigrants, and brought to alberta by french-speaking fur-traders. such winds are extremely wet and warm and arrive off the western coast of north america from the southwest. these same winds have more recently been called the pineapple express, since they are of tropical origin, roughly from the area of the pacific near hawaii. the air associated with a coastal chinook is stable; this minimizes wind gusts and often keeps winds light in sheltered areas. in exposed areas, fresh gales are frequent during a chinook, but strong gale- or storm-force winds are uncommon; most of the region\\'s stormy winds come when a fast \"westerly\" jet stream lets air masses from temperate and subarctic latitudes clash. when a coastal chinook comes in when an arctic air mass is holding steady over the coast, the tropical dampness brought in suddenly cools, penetrating the frozen air and coming down in volumes of powder snow, sometimes to sea level. snowfalls and the cold spells that spawned them only last a few days during a chinook; as the warm coastal chinooks blow from the southwest, they push back east the cold arctic air. the snow melts quickly and is gone within a week. the effects on the interior of british columbia when a coastal chinook is in effect are the reverse. in a rainy spell, most of the heavy moisture will be wrung out of the rising air as a consequence of crossing over the mountain ramparts before the air mass descends (and hence warms and dries) into the fraser canyon and the thompson river-okanagan area. the effects are similar to those of an albertan interior chinook, though not to the same extreme, partly because the okanagan is relatively warmer than the prairies, and partly because of the additional number of precipitation-catching mountain ranges between kelowna and calgary. when the coastal chinook brings snow to the coast during a period of coastal cold, bright but chilly weather in the interior will give way to a slushy melting of snow, more due to the warm spell than because of rain. pronunciation in the pacific northwest the word \"chinook\" remains in common use among local fishermen and people in communities along the british columbia coast, and coastal washington and oregon, and in particular, the term is used in the puget sound area of washington. coastal \"chinook\" is not pronounced shin-uk () as it is in the interior, east of the cascades, but is in the original coastal pronunciation chin-uk (). in british columbia and other parts of the pacific northwest, the word chinook was predominantly pronounced . however, the common pronunciation current throughout most of the inland pacific northwest, alberta, and the rest of canada, is , as in french. this difference may be because it was the métis employees of the hudson\\'s bay company, who were familiar with the chinook people and country, brought the name east of the cascades and rockies, along with their own ethnic pronunciation. early records are clear that tshinook was the original pronunciation, before the word\\'s transmission east of the rockies. first nations myth from british columbia native legend of the lil\\'wat subgroup of the st\\'at\\'imc tells of a girl named chinook-wind, who married chinook glacier, and moved to his country, which was in the area of today\\'s birkenhead river. she pined for her warm sea-home in the southwest, and sent a message to her people. they came to her in a vision in the form of snowflakes, and told her they were coming to get her. they came in great number and quarrelled with glacier over her, but they overwhelmed him and in the end she went home with them. chinooks in alberta and eastern british columbia interior chinooks are most prevalent over southern alberta in canada, especially in a belt from pincher creek and crowsnest pass through lethbridge, which get 30-35 chinook days per year, on average. interior chinooks become less frequent further south in the united states, and are not as common north of red deer, but they can and do occur annually as far north as high level in northwestern alberta and fort st. john in northeastern british columbia, and as far south as las vegas, nevada, and occasionally to carlsbad, in eastern new mexico. in pincher creek, the temperature rose by , from , in one hour on 6 january 1966. during the winter, driving can be treacherous, as the wind blows snow across roadways, sometimes causing roads to vanish and snowdrifts to pile up higher than a metre. empty semitrailer trucks driving along highway 3 and other routes in southern alberta have been blown over by the high gusts of wind caused by interior chinooks. on 27 february 1992, claresholm, alberta, a town just south of calgary, recorded a temperature of ; again, the next day was recorded. clashing with arctic air mass the interior chinooks can seem to battle with arctic air masses at times. this clash of temperatures can remain stationary, or move back and forth, in the latter case causing such fluctuations as a warm morning, a bitterly cold afternoon, and a warm evening. a curtain of fog often accompanies the clash between warm to the west and cold to the east. chinook arch two common cloud patterns seen in the interior during this time are a chinook arch overhead, and a bank of clouds (also referred to as a cloud wall) obscuring the mountains to the west. the bank appears to be an approaching storm, but does not advance any further to the east. one of its most striking features of the interior chinook weather system is the chinook arch, a föhn cloud in the form of a band of stationary stratus clouds, caused by air rippling over the mountains due to orographic lifting. to those unfamiliar with it, the chinook arch may at times look like a threatening storm cloud, however, the arch clouds rarely produce rain or snow. they can also create stunning sunrises and sunsets. a similar phenomenon, the nor\\'west arch, also a föhn cloud, is seen in southern new zealand. the stunning colors seen in the chinook arch are quite common. typically, the colours will change throughout the day, starting with yellow, orange, red, and pink shades in the morning as the sun comes up, grey shades at midday changing to pink / red colours, and then orange / yellow hues just before the sun sets. cause of occurrence the interior chinook is a föhn wind, a rain shadow wind which results from the subsequent adiabatic warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes (orographic lift). as a consequence of the different adiabatic rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than equivalent elevations on the windward slopes. sometimes the interior chinooks are caused by the same air flow as the coastal chinooks: as moist winds from the pacific (coastal chinooks) are forced to rise over the mountains, the moisture in the air is condensed and falls out as precipitation, while the air cools at the moist adiabatic rate of the dried air then descends on the leeward side of the mountains, warming at the dry adiabatic rate of the turbulence of the high winds also can prevent the usual nocturnal temperature inversion from forming on the lee side of the slope, allowing night-time temperatures to remain elevated. quite often, when the pacific northwest coast is being drenched by rain, the windward (western) side of the rockies is being hammered by snow (robbing the air of its moisture), and the leeward (eastern) side of the rockies in alberta is basking in a föhn chinook. the three different weather conditions are all caused by the same flow of air, hence the confusion over the use of the name \"chinook wind\". interior chinooks and gardening on great plains the frequent midwinter thaws by interior chinooks in great plains country are more of a bane than a blessing to gardeners. plants can be visibly brought out of dormancy by persistent, warm interior chinook winds, or have their hardiness reduced even if they appear to remain dormant. in either case, they become vulnerable to later cold waves. many plants which do well at winnipeg - where constant cold maintains dormancy throughout the winter - are difficult to grow in the alberta chinook belt. examples include basswood, some apple, raspberry, and juneberry varieties, and amur maples. native trees in the interior chinook-affected areas of alberta are known to be small, with much less growth than the same species growing in areas not affected by interior chinook winds. this is once again caused by the \"off-and-on\" dormancy throughout winter. health interior chinook winds are said to sometimes cause a sharp increase in the number of migraine headaches suffered by the locals. at least one study conducted by the department of clinical neurosciences at the university of calgary supports that belief. they are popularly believed to increase irritability and sleeplessness. in mid-winter over major centres such as calgary, interior chinooks can often override cold air in the city, trapping the pollutants in the cold air and causing inversion smog. at such times, it is possible for it to be cold at street level and much warmer at the tops of the skyscrapers and in higher terrain. chinooks and föhn winds in the inland united states in the north american western interior, winds that are generally called föhn winds by meteorologists and climatologists are called \"chinooks\". regardless of the name, föhns can occur on the leeward side of any nearby mountain range. the föhns called \"chinook winds\" are seen throughout most of inland western north america, particularly the rocky mountain region. montana especially has a significant amount of föhn winds throughout much of the state during the winter months, but particularly coming off the rocky mountain front in the northern and west-central areas of the state. on rare occasions, chinook winds generated on the eastern slope of the rocky mountains have reached as far east as wisconsin. records loma, montana has the world record for the most extreme temperature change in a 24-hour period. on january 15, 1972, the temperature increased from −54 °f to 49 °f (−48 °c to 9 °c), a 103 °f (58 °c) change in temperature. spearfish, south dakota holds the world record for the fastest increase in temperature. on january 22, 1943, the temperature increased from −4 °f to 45 °f (−20 °c to 7 °c), a 49 °f (27 °c) change in temperature. this occurred in just 2 minutes. rapid city, south dakota holds the world record for the fastest decrease in temperature. on january 10, 1911, the temperature decreased from 60 °f to 13 °f (16 °c to −11 °c), a 47 °f (26.1 °c) change in temperature. squamish winds, williwaws, and chugach föhns the resulting outflow wind is more or less the opposite of british columbia / pacific northwest coastal chinook. these are called a squamish in certain areas, rooted in the direction of such winds coming down out of howe sound, home to the squamish people, and in alaska are called a williwaw. they consist of cold airstreams from the continental air mass pouring out of the interior plateau via certain river valleys and canyons penetrating the coast mountains towards the coast. a similar, local föhn wind regularly occurs in the cook inlet region in alaska, as air moves over the chugach mountains between prince william sound and portage glacier. anchorage residents often believe the warm winds which melt snow and leave their streets slushy and muddy are a midwinter gift from hawaii, following a common mistake that the warm winds come from the same place as the similar winds near the coasts in southern british columbia, washington, and oregon. see also catabatic wind

       " 'in hydrology, routing is a technique used to predict the changes in shape of a hydrograph as water moves through a river channel or a reservoir. in flood forecasting, hydrologists may want to know how a short burst of intense rain in an area upstream of a city will change as it reaches the city. routing can be used to determine whether the pulse of rain reaches the city as a deluge or a trickle. routing also can be used to predict the hydrograph shape (and thus lowland flooding potential) subsequent to multiple rainfall events in different sub-catchments of the watershed. timing and duration of the rainfall events, as well as factors such as antecedent moisture conditions, overall watershed shape, along with subcatchment-area shapes, land slopes (topography/physiography), geology/hydrogeology (i.e. forests and aquifers can serve as giant sponges that absorb rainfall and slowly release it over subsequent weeks and months), and stream-reach lengths all play a role here. the result can be an additive effect (i.e. a large flood if each subcatchment\\'s respective hydrograph peak arrives at the watershed mouth at the same point in time, thereby effectively causing a \"stacking\" of the hydrograph peaks), or a more distributed-in-time effect (i.e. a lengthy but relatively modest flood, effectively attenuated in time, as the individual subcatchment peaks arrive at the mouth of the main watershed channel in orderly succession). other uses of routing include reservoir and channel design, floodplain studies and watershed simulations. if the water flow at a particular point, a, in a stream is measured over time with a flow gauge, this information can be used to create a hydrograph. a short period of intense rain, normally called a flood event, can cause a bulge in the graph, as the increased water travels down the river, reaches the flow gauge at a, and passes along it. if another flow gauge at b, downstream of a is set up, one would expect the graph\\'s bulge (or floodwave) to have the same shape. however, the shape of the river and flow resistance within a river (from the river bed, for example) can affect the shape of the floodwave. oftentimes, the floodwave will be attenuated (have a reduced peak flow). routing techniques can be broadly classified as hydraulic (or distributed) routing, hydrologic (or lumped) routing or semi-distributed routing. in general, based on the available field data and goals of the project, one of routing procedures is selected. hydraulic (or distributed) routing hydraulic routing is based on the solution of partial differential equations of unsteady open-channel flow. the equations used are the saint-venant equations or the associated dynamic wave equations. the hydraulic models (e.g. dynamic and diffusion wave models) require the gathering of a lot of data related to river geometry and morphology and consume a lot of computer resources in order to solve the equations numerically. hydrologic (or lumped) routing hydrologic routing uses the continuity equation for hydrology. in its simplest form, inflow to the river reach is equal to the outflow of the river reach plus the change of storage: , where i is average inflow to the reach during o is average outflow from the reach during ; and s is the water currently in the reach (known as storage) the hydrologic models (e.g. linear and nonlinear muskingum models) need to estimate hydrologic parameters using recorded data in both upstream and downstream sections of rivers and/or by applying robust optimization techniques to solve the one-dimensional conservation of mass and storage-continuity equation. semi-distributed routing semi-distributed models such as muskingum-cunge family procedures are also available. simple physical concepts and common river characteristics such as channel geometry, reach length, roughness coefficient, and slope are used to estimate the model parameters without complex and expensive numerical solutions. flood routing flood routing is a procedure to determine the time and magnitude of flow (i.e., the flow hydrograph) at a point on a watercourse from known or assumed hydrographs at one or more points upstream. the procedure is specifically known as flood routing, if the flow is a flood. after routing, the peak gets attenuated & a time lag is introduced. in order to determine the change in shape of a hydrograph of a flood as it travels through a natural river or artificial channel, different flood simulation techniques can be used. traditionally, the hydraulic (e.g. dynamic and diffusion wave models) and hydrologic (e.g. linear and nonlinear muskingum models) routing procedures that are well known as distributed and lumped ways to hydraulic and hydrologic practitioners, respectively, can be utilized. the hydrologic models need to estimate hydrologic parameters using recorded data in both upstream and downstream sections of rivers and/or by applying robust optimization techniques to solve the one-dimensional conservation of mass and storage-continuity equation. on the other hand, hydraulic models require the gathering of a lot of data related to river geometry and morphology and consume a lot of computer resources in order to solve the equations numerically. however, semi-distributed models such as muskingum-cunge family procedures are also available. simple physical concepts and common river characteristic consisting of channel geometry, reach length, roughness coefficient, and slope are used to estimate the model parameters without complex and expensive numerical solutions. in general, based on the available field data and goals of a project, one of these approaches is utilized for the simulation of flooding in rivers and channels. runoff routing runoff routing is a procedure to calculate a surface runoff hydrograph from rainfall. losses are removed from rainfall to determine the rainfall excess which is then converted to a hydrograph and routed through conceptual storages that represent the storage discharge behaviour of overland and channel flow. see also hydrograph one-dimensional saint-venant equations references hydrology soil mechanics soil physics water',\n",
       " 'alan stuart gross (born april 13, 1962) is an american politician, orthopedic surgeon and a commercial fisherman who, running as an independent candidate, was the democratic nominee for the 2020 united states senate election in alaska. he lost the race to incumbent republican dan sullivan. early life and education gross was born in juneau in 1962. he is the son of former alaska attorney general avrum and shari gross, the first executive director of the united fishermen of alaska, who also founded the league of women voters-alaska. as a child, he was part of the small jewish community in alaska, and had the first bar mitzvah in southeast alaska. while attending douglas high school in juneau, gross developed an interest in fishing, both sport and commercial. when he was 14, he bought his first commercial fishing boat with a bank loan. he commercially gillnet fished for salmon in the summer to pay his way through college and medical school. gross attended douglas high school in juneau before enrolling at amherst college, where he graduated in 1985 with a degree in neuroscience. he studied medicine at the university of washington\\'s wwami regional medical education program, graduating in 1989. medical career after graduating from medical school, gross served as the president of the bartlett regional hospital medical staff. in 2006, he founded and served as the president of the juneau bone and joint center. gross retired from full-time orthopedic surgery in 2013, but continues to work part time for the petersburg medical center, and volunteers at a training hospital in cambodia every year. gross practiced as an orthopedic surgeon in juneau, beginning in 1994. in 2013, gross left his practice, along with his wife monica gross, to study health care economics, earning a master\\'s of public health at university of california, los angeles. he has said that he grew uncomfortable with the high costs of healthcare, and pursued his mph degree to study solutions. political career after earning his mph, gross returned to alaska and began his advocacy for healthcare reform. in 2017, he co-sponsored two ballot initiatives in alaska. the quality health insurance for alaskans act sought to add certain provisions from the affordable care act into state law, including protection against discrimination based on preexisting conditions, mandatory coverage for prenatal and maternal care, and provisions that children could remain covered by their parents\\' insurance until age 26. the healthcare for alaskans act would codify the medicaid expansion, already in effect due to an executive order by governor bill walker. both initiatives were withdrawn from the ballot in december 2017. supporters cited uncertainty in healthcare policy at the federal level as the reason for the withdrawal. 2020 u.s. senate campaign on july 2, 2019, gross announced he would run as an independent in the 2020 u.s. senate election in alaska. he won the august democratic primary against democrat edgar blatchford and independent chris cumings, gaining the nomination of the alaska democratic party, which had endorsed him before the filing deadline. gross ran as an independent against republican incumbent senator dan sullivan. he had the support of the democratic senatorial campaign committee and the lincoln project. gross said, \"i stepped up to do this because the alaska economy has been failing, we\\'ve been losing alaskans to the lower 48 for the past few years, and despite that labor loss, we had the highest unemployment in the country.\" the daily beast argued that alaska \"flirts with purple-state status\" in part due to gross\\'s candidacy. there was speculation that the political fallout of the death of ruth bader ginsburg and the amy coney barrett supreme court nomination could dampen support for incumbent sullivan and benefit gross\\'s campaign. more than a week after the election, sullivan\\'s reelection in what was expected to be a close race was affirmed. in october 2021, gross ran for hospital board in petersburg, alaska and finished fourth. 2022 u.s. house campaign on march 28, 2022, gross announced he would run as an independent candidate for alaska\\'s at-large congressional seat that was vacated upon the death of congressman don young. although he won third place and the opportunity to compete in the general election, he withdrew on june 20, 2022. political positions despite receiving the alaska democratic party\\'s endorsement, gross is an independent politician and says he is closer to republicans on \"issues like guns and immigration\". gross supports an overhaul of medicare, including the addition of a public option. he also supports raising the minimum wage, defending collective bargaining rights for workers and unions, efforts to make college more affordable and accessible, and earlier tracking into trade schools. citing his background in science, gross supports policies that address climate change, including the growth of renewable energy and opposition to the pebble mine project. he also supports ending citizens united and fixing political corruption. gross fully supports instant-runoff voting. he is neutral on universal basic income (ubi), which resembles the alaska permanent fund (apf), saying, \"the ubi check here in alaska has been a great program, but any program like that, you have to be careful you don\\'t disincentivize going back to the workforce.\" environmental and energy policy gross opposes the proposed pebble mine, which threatens to harm the ecosystem of bristol bay. his campaign could have benefited from reports of sullivan\\'s inconsistency on this issue, and secretly recorded tapes in which corporate executives indicate that sullivan could switch his position on the mine after the election. gross accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and its impacts on alaska. he supports diversification of alaska\\'s economy and its energy supply, including renewable energy. like sullivan, he supports oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge. gross opposes the green new deal. foreign policy gross has said that russian and chinese interest in the arctic must be counterbalanced by a strong u.s. military. he has said that he would be a \"staunch defender\" of israel. gun policy gross has said that he is a \"strong proponent of the second amendment\" and \"will vote against banning any guns.\" he has stated support for background checks on military assault weapons. health care as a physician, gross has supported initiatives to lower health care costs. his campaign endorsed a public health care option for individuals and small businesses. in 2017, he wrote in support of single-payer, but he did not include single-payer as part of his senatorial campaign and his radio, social media and television ads initially opposed the idea. in 2020, he said he supports federal legalization of cannabis to help small businesses and others. social policy gross was endorsed by planned parenthood and the human rights campaign. electoral history 2020 references external links campaign website 1962 births 20th-century

[süddeutsche zeitung, 29 march 2021] writing about the prize in theater heute magazine, till briegleb praises the way that \"with great authority, crimp sketches the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that wants to ignore all connections between their tranquil existence and the violence that makes it possible. from the murderer to the child, everyone who appears is unique, their life-lies and fears individual.\" martin crimp is sometimes described as a practitioner of the \"in-yer-face\" school of contemporary british drama, although he rejects the label. in 2022, he performed his play not one of these people, which gave voice to 299 different characters. supported with a live deepfake video generator, imagined by quebec director christian lapointe, the playwright accepted lapointe\\'s invitation to perform as an actor on stage for the first time. theatre translator from 1997 onwards, crimp has had a parallel career as theatre translator, making his first impact at the royal court theatre with a translation of ionesco\\'s the chairs, a production that subsequently transferred to broadway. his re-writings of molière\\'s the misanthrope (1996, revived 2009) and rostand\\'s cyrano de bergerac (2019/22) were both commercially and critically successful, the latter transferring from london\\'s west end to the brooklyn academy of music. these rewritings have led some critics to see them as new plays. angelaki, for example, argues that \"crimp\\'s radical adaptations … depart substantially from the early versions of the texts that inspire them and as such belong to a discussion of crimp\\'s playwriting canon, rather than of his translations or versions\" [angelaki, vicky, op. cit. page 154] opera librettist in 2006, crimp began a collaboration with composer george benjamin that has led to the creation of three operas: into the little hill (2006), written on skin (2012) and lessons in love and violence (2018). written on skin in particular has garnered international acclaim since its premiere at the festival d\\'aix en provence in 2012. works plays not one of these people (carrefour international de théâtre théâtre la bordée 2022 ) when we have sufficiently tortured each other: 12 variations on samuel richardson\\'s pamela, (\"provoked\" by richardson\\'s pamela, national theatre, dorfman, 2019) men asleep (deutsches shauspielhaus 2018) the rest will be familiar to you from cinema (inspired by euripides\\' phoenician women, deutsches shauspielhaus 2013) in the republic of happiness (royal court theatre 2012) play house (orange tree 2012, revived with definitely the bahamas and directed by the author) the city (royal court, jerwood theatre downstairs 2008) fewer emergencies (royal court, theatre upstairs 2005) cruel and tender (young vic 2004) advice to iraqi women (royal court 2003) face to the wall (royal court 2002) the country (royal court 2000, revived at the tabard theatre may 2008) attempts on her life (royal court 1997;

       " 'yankev shternberg (in english language texts occasionally referred to as jacob sternberg; ; ; 1890, lipcani, bessarabia, russian empire - 1973, moscow, ussr) was a yiddish theater director, teacher of theater, playwright, avant-garde poet and short-story writer, best known for his theater work in romania between the two world wars. biography shternberg grew up in the northern bessarabian shtetl of lipkany (yiddish: lipkon, now lipcani in moldova), which was famously termed \"bessarabian olympus\" by hebrew and yiddish poet chaim nachman bialik and which in the second half of the 19th century produced several major figures of the modern yiddish and hebrew belle-lettres, among them yehuda shteinberg and eliezer steinbarg. he attended a russian secondary school in kamenets-podolsky, where he was a classmate and close friend of the future yiddish writer moyshe altman. shternberg debuted in 1908 with a fairy tale in the newspaper unzer lebn (odessa). he published poetry in reizen\\'s collections \"fraye erd\" (1910) and \"dos naye land\" (1911). in the 1910s, he published poetry in the periodicals hamer (brăila), frayhayt, arbeter tsaytung, and dos naye lebm (all in czernowitz), as well as gut morgn (odessa), (warsaw), and tsayt (new york). in 1914 shternberg settled in romania, at first in czernowitz (chernivtsi, ukraine), and later in bucharest. he became associated with the short-lived yiddish-language magazine likht (\"light\"), four issues of which were published in iaşi between december 1914 and september 1915. likht called for a \"renaissance of the jewish stages in romania\" and condemned the \"poor foundation\" of yiddish theater as a commercial institution: \"the yiddish stage ought to be a place of education, of drawing jews closer together through the yiddish word… we will fight against this [commercial] state of things.\" israil bercovici counts the \"literary-musical\" gatherings sponsored by that magazine as \"the beginning of modern yiddish theater in romania\", and sees shternberg as preparing the way for the vilna troupe, the yiddish theater troupe that brought the ideas of konstantin stanislavski to romania. nonetheless, shternberg adopted as a slogan \"back to goldfaden\". calling abraham goldfaden \"the prince charming who woke up the lethargic romanian jewish culture\" when he founded professional yiddish theater in 1876 (iaşi), shternberg wrote, \"the only milieu that attracts the great jewish masses is a traditional-cultural theater. not even a literary theater… from that i created a social-political theater, a theater… [of current events]… which i think was, then, the first of its kind in yiddish\". in 1917-18, shternberg and jacob botoshansky together founded a yiddish revue theater in bucharest, for which they wrote and produced nine short plays (revues), including tsimes (named after the traditional pureed vegetable dish tsimes), bukaresht-yerusholaim (\"bucharest-jerusalem\"), (\"all of a sudden\"), grine bleter (\"green leaves\"), kukuriku, sholem-aleykhem (\"hello\"), and hershele ostropoler (\"hershele of ostropol\"). in 1917, in response to antisemitic violence at that time in romania and elsewhere in eastern europe, he staged passages from bialik. in 1920, he became the editor of \"der veker\", official organ of the jewish section of the romanian socialist party. in 1924-26, he was the director for the \"vilner trupe\". the romanian daily newspaper adevărul wrote on august 23, 1924, shortly after the troupe\\'s arrival in bucharest, that \"such a demonstration of artistry, even on a small stage such as jigniţa and even in a language like yiddish ought to be seen by all who are interested in superior realization of drama.\" in 1930 he created a hugely successful studio theater bits (\"bukareshter yidishe teater-studiye\"), housed in bucharest\\'s jewish quarter văcărești, that played a prominent role in the development of modern trends in european theater. bits staged works of osip dymov (yashke-muzikant - \"yashka the musician\"), jacob gordin, i.l. peretz (banakht afn altn mark - \"a night at the old market\"), sholem aleichem (oytser - \"treasure\", and most famously der farkishefter shnayder - \"the enchanted tailor\"), (der geler shotn, 1935), nikolai gogol (zhenit\\'ba - \"the marriage\"), - mostly musical comedies with elements of grotesque, but also i.y. singer\\'s yoshe kalb and his own play teater in flamen (\"theater in flames\") on the theme of the then-ongoing spanish civil war. sidi tal starred in many of these productions. the performances were popular with the bucharest intelligentsia and peretz\\'s \"banakht afn altn mark\", for one, was played more than 150 times. during this time, shternberg published his first collection of poetry, in bucharest (1938). as antisemitic, pro-fascist tendencies gained power in bucharest, the theater left for a prolonged tour of major european cities and eventually shternberg moved to czernowitz, where he continued his theatrical activities. in 1939, shternberg along with moyshe altman sneaked across the dniester and became a soviet citizen. a year later, when his native bessarabia was annexed by the soviet union, he and most of his former troupe settled in kishinev, where shternberg became artistic director of the yiddish-language moldovan state jewish theater and staged, among other works, m. daniel\\'s zyamke kopatsh and sholom-aleichem\\'s motl peysi dem khazns (\"motl peysi, the cantor\\'s son\") with sidi tal in the boys\\' roles. during the war, he and his theatre evacuated to uzbekistan, where he worked for the jewish anti-fascist committee and was mobilized into a paramilitary construction unit. after the war, he returned to kishinev and resumed his work at the moldovan state jewish theater, where he staged his play di balade fun der esesovke brunhilde un ir hunt (\"the ballad of the ss soldier brunhilde and her dog\") and published poetry in the almanac heymland (1948). he was arrested at the height of the stalin\\'s campaign against \"rootless cosmopolitans\" (jews) in the spring of 1949 and was sent to labour camps for 7 years. on his early return and rehabilitation 5 years later, shternberg settled in moscow and worked as a translator of romanian literary works into russian. he began to publish literary essays and poetry in the newly founded sovetish heymland in 1961 and briefly became a member of its editorial board. collections of his poetry were published in bucharest and paris, and in hebrew translation by shlionsky and penn in israel on the occasion of his 75th birthday. shternberg died of a heart attack in 1973 on the very day he received a permission to leave for israel. his wife, the composer otiliya likhtenshteyn, who set his poems and those of other soviet yiddish poets (first of all leib kvitko) to music, died the same year. a collection of shternberg\\'s literary essays on theatrical topics was published posthumously in israel. a committed socialist, shternberg wrote that, in the wake of the october revolution, \"we satirized bourgeois assimilation, struggled with the [jewish] clergy, fought for progressive jewish culture, for the emancipation of the jews, for the rights of citizenship… for progressive jewish literature.\" books shtot in profil. lid un grotesk (\"city in profile. poetry and grotesque\", bucharest, 1935) izbrannoe\" (\"collected poetry\", in russian, moscow: sovetskiy pisatel\\', 1954) lid un balade af di karpatn (\"songs and ballads of the carpathians\", paris: afsnay, 1968) in krayz fun yorn (geklibene lider) (\"at the crossing of years\" (collected poems)\", bucharest: kriterion, 1970) veygn literatur un teater (\"on literature and theater\" (critical essays), tel aviv, 1987) notes and references bercovici, israil, o sută de ani de teatru evriesc în românia\\'\\' (\"one hundred years of yiddish/jewish theater in romania\"), 2nd romanian-language edition, revised and augmented by constantin măciucă. editura integral (an imprint of editurile universala), bucharest (1998). . 116-119 and 148. also, 125-143 is an extensive discussion of the vilner trupe\\'s activities in bucharest. external links 1890 births 1973 deaths people from briceni district people from khotinsky uyezd moldovan jews bessarabian jews yiddish-language poets yiddish theatre soviet writers moldovan writers moldovan male writers jewish romanian writers jewish socialists 20th-century poets 20th-century romanian male writers romanian ashkenazi jews',\n",

       " 'airgíalla (modern irish: oirialla, english: oriel, latin: ergallia) was a medieval irish over-kingdom and the collective name for the confederation of tribes that formed it. the confederation consisted of nine minor kingdoms, all independent of each other but paying nominal suzerainty to an overking, usually from the most powerful dynasty. airgíalla at its peak roughly matched the modern dioceses of armagh and clogher, spanning parts of counties armagh, monaghan, louth, fermanagh, tyrone and londonderry. its main towns were armagh and clogher. the name\\'s usage survives as a cultural area of folk tradition in south east ulster and adjoining areas of county louth. according to legend, airgíalla was founded by the three collas, who are said to have conquered what is now central ulster from the ulaid. the decisive victory was the battle of achadh leithdheirg, said to have been fought around the year 331. however, this tale is thought to be mostly fiction, and the actual year and circumstances of how the airgíalla confederation came about is unknown. originally thought to have been under the dominance of the neighbouring ulaid to the east, the territory of the airgíalla from the 6th century onwards was gradually eroded by the encroachment of their northern neighbours, the cenél neógain of the northern uí néill, as well as the southern uí néill to their south. from 735 they fell under the dominance of the cenél neógain, and by 827 had become their vassals. the kingdom of airgíalla was at its peak in the 12th century, under king donnchad ua cerbaill. the later constricted kingdom of airgíalla survived in monaghan—which was known as oirghialla and oriel after the norman invasion of ireland—under the mac mathghamhna, until the end of the gaelic order in ireland. etymology airgíalla may mean \"those who give hostages\" or \"the hostage givers\", and refers to both the irish over-kingdom of airgíalla, and the confederation of tribes that formed it. it is commonly anglicised as oriel; however, archaic angliciations include: uriel, orial, orgialla, orgiall, oryallia, and ergallia. after the anglo-norman invasion, the anglicisation \"uriel\" became the name of the part of airgíalla that had extended into modern-day county louth. similarly, the portion of airgíalla that survived in modern-day county monaghan, became known as oirghialla, from which derives the anglicisation \"oriel\". in early manuscripts the bishop of clogher was styled bishop of oirialla. history origins according to legend in the beginning of the 4th century, three warlike brothers, known as the three collas, made a conquest of a great part of ulster, which they wrested from the ulaid. it was the after the battle of achadh leithdheirg, fought around 331, that they founded airgíalla. in this battle the forces of the three collas defeated the forces of fergus foga, king of ulster, who was slain, and the victors burned to the ground emain macha, the ancient capital of ulaid. however, in general it can be shown that the origin legend was written (or composed) in the second quarter of the 8th century to seal their alliance with the northern uí néill. historical emergence the earliest reference to the airgíalla occurs in the annals of tigernach under the year 677, where the death of dunchad mac ultan, \"rí oigriall\", is noted. however, it is suspected of being a retrospective interpolation. on the other hand, the entry in the annals of ulster under the year 697 which lists mael fothataig mac mael dub as \"rex na nairgialla\" may indeed be genuine. both mael fothatag and his son, eochu lemnae (died 704), are listed among the guarantors of the \"cáin adomnáin\" in 697. thus it is believed that the airgíalla were probably in existence as an entity by then, or certainly by the opening years of the 8th century. 8th-12th centuries 13th-16th centuries downfall of the realm the kingdom of airgíalla came to an end in 1585 when rossa boy macmahon agreed to surrender and regrant his territories to the english crown in ireland, with his territory becoming county monaghan in the tudor kingdom of ireland. rossa buidhe had ascended to the airgíalla kingship in 1579 and found himself geopolitically in an undesirable position; wedged between an expanding tudor kingdom and tír eoghain under the o\\'neill. initially, rossa boy made moves which suggested an alliance with tír eoghain, as he married the daughter of hugh o\\'neill, earl of tyrone. however, evidently hoping to be left alone to run affairs locally, while pledging allegiance to a distant monarch in elizabeth i, the macmahon met with john perrot, then lord deputy of ireland (according to some, a natural son of tudor monarch henry viii) and agreed to join their kingdom of ireland. airgíalla, now known as monaghan, was divided into five baronies under native gaelic chiefs, mostly from the macmahon themselves. this was not the end of the matter, however. fearing the encroachment of the english, moving in closer and closer to his own territories, hugh o\\'neill turned to brian mac hugh og macmahon of dartree and married off another daughter to him. brian mac hugh og was then the tanist to the chieftainship of his people according to the native brehon laws and o\\'neill was hoping to bring the \"phantom\" airgíalla realm back into his camp on the death of rossa buidhe through this pact. for his part, ross buidhe was trying to engineer a pro-english succession through his brother hugh roe macmahon. when the new lord deputy, william fitzwilliam began to pressure the acceptance of an english high sheriff of monaghan, o\\'neill used his influence to exact opposition to it from clansmen in monaghan (the same policy was promoted in leitrim, fermanagh and donegal to encircle tyrone). as a consequence, a military force led by henry bagenal was sent into the county in early 1589 to impose the sheriff and by the summer of that year, rossa boy was dead. dynastic groups airgíalla was composed of nine minor-kingdoms, each named after their ruling dynasty. these were: uí tuirtri, also spelt as uí tuirtre, meaning \"descendants of tort\". they were based east of the sperrin mountains in eastern county londonderry and tyrone. from 776, the uí thuirtri had moved east of the river bann and into the over-kingdom of ulaid, and by 919 they had lost all links to the airgíalla. uí maic cairthinn, meaning \"descendants of cairthend\". based south of lough foyle in north-western county londonderry. uí fiachrach arda sratha, meaning \"descendants of fiachrach of ard straw\". based at ardstraw in modern-day county tyrone. they became subject to the cenél neógain by the 12th-century, and expanded southwards into fir luírg, in county fermanagh. uí cremthainn, based in what is now parts of modern-day county fermanagh, monaghan, and tyrone. uí méith, based in modern-day county monaghan. airthir, meaning \"easterners\". they were based around the city of armagh, and held control of the offices of the church in armagh, which had preeminence in ireland. mugdorna, based in county monaghan, however by the 12th-century had settled the territory of bairrche, located in southern county down, and named it after themselves. their name lives on as \"mourne\", the present-day name for the area and the mourne mountains. fir chraíbe, also known as the fir na chraíbe, meaning \"men of the branch\". they were located west of the river bann in north-eastern county londonderry. by the 9th-century they were a subject-people of the cenél neógain. fir lí, also known as the fir lee, meaning \"people of lí\". they were located west of the river bann in mid-eastern county londonderry. by the 9th-century they were a subject-people of the cenél neógain. uí moccu úais the uí tuirtri, uí maic cairthinn, and uí fiachrach arda sratha, were collectively known as the uí moccu úais as they claimed descent from colla uais. the pedigrees in the book of leinster states that colla uais had two sons, erc and fiachra tort. from fiachra tort came the uí tuirtri. from erc, came cairthend and fiachrach, who were respectively the ancestors of the uí maic cairthinn and the uí fiachrach arda sratha. the fir lí are also claimed as being descended from fiachra tort, though other sources claim they descend from another son of colla uais called faradach. the uí moccu uais were also found in counties meath and westmeath. they were known as uí moccu uais midi and uí moccu uais breg, meaning the uí moccu uais of meath and brega, respectively. list of kings colga mac loite mac cruinn, died 513 cairpre daim argat, died 514 daimine daim argat, died 565 conall derg mac daimine bec mac cuanu, died 594 aed mac

       " 'the qed manifesto was a proposal for a computer-based database of all mathematical knowledge, strictly formalized and with all proofs having been checked automatically. (q.e.d. means in latin, meaning \"which was to be demonstrated.\") overview the idea for the project arose in 1993, mainly under the impetus of robert boyer. the goals of the project, tentatively named qed project or project qed, were outlined in the qed manifesto, a document first published in 1994, with input from several researchers. explicit authorship was deliberately avoided. a dedicated mailing list was created, and two scientific conferences on qed took place, the first one in 1994 at argonne national laboratories and the second in 1995 in warsaw organized by the mizar group. the project seems to have dissolved by 1996, never having produced more than discussions and plans. in a 2007 paper, freek wiedijk identifies two reasons for the failure of the project. in order of importance: very few people are working on formalization of mathematics. there is no compelling application for fully mechanized mathematics. formalized mathematics does not yet resemble real, traditional mathematics. this is partly due to the complexity of mathematical notation, and partly to the limitations of existing theorem provers and proof assistants; the paper finds that the major contenders, mizar, hol, and coq, have serious shortcomings in their abilities to express mathematics. nonetheless, qed-style projects are regularly proposed. the mizar mathematical library formalizes a large portion of undergraduate mathematics, and was considered the largest such library in 2007. similar projects include the metamath proof database and the mathlib library written in lean. in 2014 the twenty years of the qed manifesto workshop was organized as part of the vienna summer of logic. see also formalism (mathematics) mathematical knowledge management poplmark, a more modest project in programming language theory references further reading h. barendregt & f. wiedijk, the challenge of computer mathematics, transactions a of the royal society 363 no. 1835, 2351-2375, 2005 (open access issue) richard a. de millo, richard j. lipton, alan j. perlis, social processes and proofs of theorems and programs, communications of the acm, volume 22, issue 5 (may 1979), pages: 271 - 280 john harrison, formalized mathematics, technical report 36, turku centre for computer science (tucs) ittay weiss, the qed manifesto after two decades \\uf0be version 2.0, journal of software vol. 11, no. 8, pp. 803-815, 2016. external links freek wiedijk, formalizing 100 theorems a page keeping track of the progress in the formalization of 100 common theorems. freek wiedijk, the seventeen provers of the world, a proof of the irrationality of the square root of two in seventeen different proof assistants. formalized mathematics a journal in which mizar proofs are presented. the archive of formal proofs a similar (refereed) repository of proofs in isabelle/hol. a repository of proofs in coq. unimath \"coq library aims to formalize a substantial body of mathematics using the univalent point of view\" educational projects formal methods mathematics literature proof assistants',\n",

       " 'a cum shot is the depiction of human ejaculation, especially onto another person. the term is usually applied to depictions occurring in pornographic films, photographs, and magazines. unlike ejaculation in non-pornographic sex, cum shots typically involve ejeculation outside the receiver\\'s body, allowing the viewer to see the ejaculation in progress. facial cum shots (or \"facials\") are regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene. cum shots may also depict ejaculation onto another performer\\'s body, such as on the genitals, buttocks, chest or tongue. the term is typically used by the cinematographer within the narrative framework of a pornographic film, and, since the 1970s, it has become a leitmotif of the hardcore genre. two exceptions are softcore pornography, in which penetration is not explicitly shown, and \"couples erotica\", which may involve penetration but is typically filmed in a more discreet manner intended to be romantic or educational rather than graphic. softcore pornography that does not contain ejaculation sequences is produced both to respond to a demand by some consumers for less-explicit pornographic material and to comply with government regulations or cable company rules that may disallow depictions of ejaculation. cum shots typically do not appear in \"girl-girl\" scenes (female ejaculation scenes exist, but are relatively rare); orgasm is instead implied by utterances, cinematic conventions, or body movement. cum shots have become the object of fetish genres like bukkake, in which the cum shot replaces the sex act completely. terminology a cum shot may also be called a cumshot, come shot, cum blast, pop shot or money shot. originally, in general film-making usage the term money shot was a reference to the scene that cost the most money to produce; in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence is being counted on to become a selling point for the film. for example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of an explosion might be called the \"money shot\" of the film. the use of money shot to denote the ejaculation scene in pornographic films is attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it. the meaning of the term money shot has sometimes been borrowed back from pornography by the film and tv industry with a meaning closer to that used in pornographic films. for example, in tv talk shows, the term, borrowed from pornography, denotes a highly emotional scene, expressed in visible bodily terms. origin and features although earlier pornographic films occasionally contained footage of ejaculation, it was not until the advent of hard-core pornography in the 1970s that the stereotypical cum shot scene became a standard feature—displaying ejaculation with maximum visibility. the 1972 film behind the green door featured a seven-minute-long sequence described by linda williams, professor of film studies, as \"optically printed, psychedelically colored doublings of the ejaculating penis\". steven ziplow\\'s the film maker\\'s guide to pornography (1977) states: cum shot scenes may involve the female actor calling for the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body. cultural analysis researcher murat aydemir considers this one of the three quintessential aspects of the cum shot scene, alongside the emphasis on visible ejaculation and the timing of the cum shot, which usually concludes a hard-core scene. as a possible alternative explanation for the rise of the cum shot in hardcore pornography, joseph slade, professor at ohio university and author of pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide notes that pornography actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude. health risks transmission of disease any sexual activity that involves contact with the bodily fluids of another person contains the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed. however, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as hiv and hepatitis. the california occupational safety and health administration categorizes semen as \"other potentially infectious material\" or opim. aside from other sexual activity that may have occurred prior to performing a facial, the risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner are drastically different. for the ejaculating partner, there is almost no risk of contracting an std. for the receiving partner, the risk is higher. since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive mucous membranes (eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease. allergic reactions in rare cases, people have been known to experience allergic reactions to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma hypersensitivity. symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. they may also include hives and even difficulty breathing. options for prevention of semen allergy include avoiding exposure to seminal fluid by use of condoms and attempting desensitization. treatment options include diphenhydramine and/or an injection of epinephrine. criticisms and responses one critic of \"cum shot\" scenes in heterosexual pornography was the us porn star-turned-writer, director and producer candida royalle. she produced pornography films aimed at women and their partners that avoid the \"misogynous predictability\" and depiction of sex in \"...as grotesque and graphic [a way] as possible.\" royalle also criticizes the male-centredness of the typical pornography film, in which scenes end when the male actor ejaculates. women\\'s activist beatrice faust argued, \"since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism. this occurs in both homosexual and pornography so that ejaculation cannot be interpreted as an expression of contempt for women only.\" she goes on to say \"logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is as healthy as sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture.\" sexologist peter sándor gardos argues that his research suggests that \"... the men who get most turned on by watching cum shots are the ones who have positive attitudes toward women\" (at the annual meeting of the society for the scientific study of sex in 1992). later, at the world pornography conference in 1998, he reported a similar conclusion, namely that \"no pornographic image is interpretable outside of its historical and social context. harm or degradation does not reside in the image itself.\" cindy patton, activist and scholar on human sexuality, argues that, in western culture, male sexual fulfillment is synonymous with orgasm and that the male orgasm is an essential punctuation of the sexual narrative. no orgasm, no sexual pleasure. no cum shot, no narrative closure. the cum shot is the period at the end of the sentence. in her essay \"visualizing safe sex: when pedagogy and pornography collide\", patton reached the conclusion that critics have devoted too little space to discovering the meaning that viewers attach to specific acts such as cum shots. see also

it amends the citizenship oath to include loyalty to new zealand, and respect for the democratic values of new zealand and respect for the rights and freedoms of its people; it provides a māori version of each oath. the act provides that using a māori equivalent of any of the oaths set out in that act shall have full legal effect; it amends the act to prescribe a māori language version of the words with which an affirmation must begin. the monarchist league was pleased with this outcome, stating, \"while it may be questioned what \\'loyalty to new zealand\\', and \\'respect for its democratic values\\' actually mean, it is heartening that no attempt was made to remove the oath of allegiance to the queen.\" the republican movement stated that \"[t]he best thing about the new oaths is that they can easily be changed when we become a republic\". after passing the first reading and going to the government administration committee, the bill had its second reading discharged on 1 june 2010, meaning it will not proceed. hone harawira amendment in 2007, then māori party mp hone harawira put up an amendment (in the form of a supplementary order paper) to the oaths modernisation bill inserting references to the oaths and affirmations to \"uphold the treaty of waitangi\". harawira eventually split from the māori party and resigned from parliament to re-contest his seat as leader of the mana party. he won the subsequent by-election. on 14 july 2011, harawira was removed from the chamber by the speaker of the house, lockwood smith, for not pledging the oath of allegiance as required by law. see also republicanism in new zealand oath of allegiance oath of allegiance (united kingdom) oath of allegiance (australia) oath of allegiance (canada) references external links oaths and declarations act 1957 oaths modernisation bill new zealand government of new zealand monarchy in new zealand',\n",

       " \"the pembrokeshire militia, later the royal pembroke rifles, was an auxiliary regiment reorganised from earlier precursor units in the welsh county of pembrokeshire during the 18th century. primarily intended for home defence, it served in britain and ireland through all britain's major wars. it was converted into garrison artillery in 1853 and continued until it was disbanded in 1909. pembroke trained bands the universal obligation to military service in the shire levy was long established in england and was extended to wales. king henry viii called a 'great muster' in 1539, which showed the following available in the newly reorganised county of pembrokeshire: county of pembrokeshire: 1166 men available for service, of whom 139 had 'harness' (armour) lordship of haverfordwest: 454 (43 with harness) tenants of thomas jones in both those places and in the hundred of dewisland: 380 with 4 'nags' (horses) cilgerran hundred: 254 the legal basis of the militia was updated by two acts of 1557 covering musters and the maintenance of horses and armour. the county militia was now under the lord lieutenant, assisted by the deputy lieutenants and justices of the peace (jps). the entry into force of these acts in 1558 is seen as the starting date for the organised militia of england and wales. although the militia obligation was universal, it was clearly impractical to train and equip every able-bodied man, so after 1572 the practice was to select a proportion of men for the trained bands, who were mustered for regular training. during the armada crisis of 1588 pembrokeshire furnished 800 trained foot and 30 'petronel's (the petronel was an early cavalry firearm). in the 16th century little distinction was made between the militia and the troops levied by the counties for overseas expeditions. however, the counties usually conscripted the unemployed and criminals rather than send the trained bandsmen. between 1585 and 1602 pembrokeshire supplied 610 men for service in ireland and 30 for the netherlands. the levies were commanded by professional captains rather than local men: in 1601 a captain who had raised 100 troops in gloucestershire was ordered to take the 50 from pembrokeshire under his command as well. the men were given 'conduct money' to get to the embarkation ports. this was recovered from the government, but replacing the weapons issued to the levies from the militia armouries was a heavy cost on the counties. with the passing of the threat of invasion, the trained bands declined in the early 17th century. later, king charles i attempted to reform them into a national force or 'perfect militia' answering to the king rather than local control. the pembrokeshire trained bands of 1638 consisted of 557 men, 276 armed with muskets and 281 'corslets' (body armour, signifying pikemen). they also mustered 57 horse. part of this force may have been organised as the north pembroke trained band. pembrokeshire was ordered to send 300 men overland to newcastle upon tyne for the second bishops' war of 1640. however, substitution was rife and many of those sent on this unpopular service would have been untrained replacements. civil wars control of the militia was one of the areas of dispute between charles i and parliament that led to the english civil war. when open war broke out between the king and parliament, neither side made much use of the trained bands beyond securing the county armouries for their own full-time troops. most of wales was under royalist control for much of the war, and was a recruiting ground for the king's armies. however, pembrokeshire was divided, with the coastal towns of pembroke and tenby leaning towards parliament. these were vital for the royal army to land supplies and reinforcements from ireland. on 18 september 1643 during his campaign to take these two towns, the earl of carbery as the king's lieutenant-general for carmarthenshire, cardiganshire and pembrokeshire, summoned the pembrokeshire tbs to haverfordwest, where they declared for the king and were presumably absorbed into his army. however, pembroke and tenby were later recovered by rowland laugharne for parliament. once parliament had established full control in 1648 it passed new militia acts that replaced lords lieutenant with county commissioners appointed by parliament or the council of state. at the same time the term 'trained band' began to disappear in most counties. under the commonwealth and protectorate the militia received pay when called out, and operated alongside the new model army to control the country. by 1651 the militias of the south welsh counties appear to have been combined, with the 'south wales militia' being ordered to rendezvous at gloucester to hold the city during the worcester campaign. pembrokeshire militia after the restoration of the monarchy, the militia was re-established by the the king's sole right over the militia act 1661 under the control of the king's lords lieutenant, the men to be selected by ballot. this was popularly seen as the 'constitutional force' to counterbalance a 'standing army' tainted by association with the new model army that had supported cromwell's military dictatorship. the militia forces in the welsh counties were small, and were grouped together under the direction of the lord president of the council of wales. as lord president, the duke of beaufort carried out a tour of inspection of the welsh militia in 1684. on 11 august, when he inspected the pembrokeshire militia near haverfordwest, it consisted of a regiment of foot ('all of firelocks', ie musketeers with no pikemen) and one troop of horse. the 1697 militia returns showed the foot as 456 strong under colonel sir thomas stepney, 5th baronet, high sheriff of pembrokeshire, organised in seven companies (one commanded by the mayor of pembroke), and the troop of 36 horse under captain arthur owen, mp for pembrokeshire. generally the militia declined in the long peace after the treaty of utrecht in 1713. jacobites were numerous amongst the welsh militia, but they did not show their hands during the risings of 1715 and 1745, and bloodshed was avoided. 1757 reforms seven years' war under threat of french invasion during the seven years' war a series of militia acts from 1757 re-established county militia regiments, the men being conscripted by means of parish ballots (paid substitutes were permitted) to serve for three years. there was a property qualification for officers, who were commissioned by the lord lieutenant. an adjutant and drill sergeants were to be provided to each regiment from the regular army, and arms and accoutrements would be supplied when the county had secured 60 per cent of its quota of recruits. pembrokeshire was given a quota of 160 men to raise. some of the welsh counties were slow to complete their regiments: the problem was less with the other ranks raised by ballot than the shortage of men qualified to be officers, even after the requirements were lowered for welsh counties. on 29 july 1758 sir william owen, 4th baronet, of orielton, the lord lieutenant of pembrokeshire, advertised for suitably qualified men to come forward, and must have obtained a sufficient number: he appointed his eldest son, hugh owen (later 5th baronet) as colonel. the militia ballot was then enforced and the pembrokeshire regiment received its arms on 7 september 1759. it was embodied for permanent service at haverfordwest, pembroke town and narberth on 15 december that year. after a short period of training and organised into four small companies the regiment marched off in january 1760 to take up garrison duties at bristol. in february it was posted to monmouthshire, where it alternated between monmouth and chepstow until the end of may. it was then posted to carmarthen, arriving on 6 june, and remained there before returning to pembrokeshire in october. the following spring it served in cardiganshire, with companies in various towns including cardigan and aberystwyth. it went back to pembrokeshire in august 1761, with various detachments until it concentrated at haverfordwest in november 1762. the war was coming to an end, and the warrant to disembody the regiment was executed on 4 december 1762. the disembodied regiment was kept up to strength by means of the ballot over subsequent years, but it was rarely assembled for training. american war of independence the american war of independence broke out in 1775, and by 1778 britain was threatened with invasion by the americans' allies, france and spain. the militia were embodied, and the pembrokeshires were called out on 26 march, assembling at haverfordwest shortly afterwards under the command of major wyriot owen. his second-in-command was capt john colby, brother-in-law of the former colonel, now sir hugh owen, 5th baronet of orielton and lord lieutenant of pembrokeshire. on 1 may 1778 the regiment was ordered to bristol, and from there it was marched to coxheath camp near maidstone in kent. this was the army's largest training camp, where the militia were exercised as part of a division alongside regular troops while providing a reserve in case of french invasion of south east england. the understrength militia units from small counties (montgomery, radnor and pembroke) were attached to guard the artillery park of the division. on 4 november the camp broke up and the pembrokeshires marched into maidstone for winter quarters, sending parties back to haverfordwest to collect recruits. the regiment spent the summer of 1779 in essex, where it joined other militia regiments at warley camp. by november detachments were billeted in villages north and east of london, but the regiment then marched off to winter quarters in haverfordwest, arriving on 18 december. colby took command of the regiment in january 1780 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. in addition to its balloted companies, the regiment now had two companies enlisted from volunteers, one of which was designated the light company. the regiment moved to pembroke in january, and then in may marched to tiptree camp in essex. the gordon riots broke out in london in june, and the pembroke militia was called out in aid of the civil power, with short deployments to brentwood and romford, without any clashes occurring. in the winter the regiment was quartered across essex with detachments including harwich and wivenhoe. in february 1781 the harwich detachment relieved the radnorshire militia at landguard fort and the wivenhoe detachment moved into ipswich. the following winter the regiment was again distributed across essex towns and villages. in spring 1782 the pembrokeshires returned to coxheath camp, where it became part of a brigade including the brecknockshire and merionethshire militia regiments and sir john leicester's dragoons, all commanded by lt-col colby. the pembrokeshires remained in kent for the winter, with two companies at dover, one at folkestone and the remainder at hythe and sandgate. much of the duty involved guarding prisoners-of-war. a peace treaty had been agreed and the war was now coming to an end, so warrants to disembody the militia were issued on 28 february 1783. the pembrokeshires marched back to haverfordwest where they were disembodied in mid- march. from 1784 to 1792 the militia ballot was used to keep up militia numbers and the regiments were assembled for their 28 days' annual peacetime training, but to save money only two-thirds of the men were actually mustered each year. the lord lieutenant of pembrokeshire, richard philipps, 1st lord milford, became colonel of the regiment on 10 june 1786, but john colby remained lieutenant-colonel. french revolutionary war the militia was already being called out when revolutionary france declared war on britain on 1 february 1793. the pembrokeshire militia under lt-col colby had already been embodied at haverfordwest on 2 january and later that month it marched via worcester to romford in essex, where it was stationed until june. the french revolutionary wars saw a new phase for the english militia: they were embodied for a whole generation, and became regiments of full-time professional soldiers (though restricted to service in the british isles), which the regular army increasingly saw as a prime source of recruits. they served in coast defences, manning garrisons, guarding prisoners-of-war, and for internal security, while their traditional local defence duties were taken over by the volunteers and mounted yeomanry. from july to october 1793 the pembrokeshire militia was at warley camp, then returned to romford and hare street for the winter, during which it received a draft of newly-balloted men from pembrokeshire. between february and june 1794 it was quartered across various essex villages before concentrating at warley. in november it transferred to yarmouth in norfolk, where all ranks were billeted in public houses and inns until may 1795. that month it moved into a tented camp outside the town. in october and november it went to various village before settling at holt for the winter. in april 1796 the regiment joined the garrison at landguard fort where it provided 'additional gunners'. in a fresh attempt to have as many men as possible under arms for home defence in order to release regulars, in 1796 the government created the supplementary militia, a compulsory levy of men to be trained in their spare time, and to be incorporated in the regular militia in emergency. pembrokeshire's new militia quota was fixed at 331 men. lieutenant-col colby went back to pembrokeshire to supervise the training of the county's supplementaries and was on the scene on 22 february 1797 when a french force landed at fishguard on the north pembrokeshire coast. a force of militia, yeomanry and volunteers was quickly gathered at haverfordwest under the command of lord cawdor to oppose this invasion. colby sent his pembroke supplementaries to relieve a detachment of the cardiganshire militia guarding the prisoners at pembroke dock, allowing the better-trained cardigan men to join cawdor. colby himself was probably with cawdor as an adviser during the minor skirmishing that followed (the battle of fishguard) and the subsequent negotiations for the french surrender. by july the pembroke supplementaries had completed their training, and those who did not accept a bounty to join the regular army were marched off to join the regiment at landguard fort. on 13 september the regiment marched to take over garrison duties at bristol. ireland 1799 in 1798 a rebellion broke out in ireland and an act of parliament was passed to allow english and welsh militia regiments to serve there. the pembrokeshires volunteered for six months' service and embarked at bristol on 6 april 1799. the regiment arrived at cork on 18 april, by which time the rebellion had been crushed. after six months' uneventful service, colby (who had been promoted to colonel on 23 april) endeavoured to induce the men to extend their service, but they were unwilling, and the regiment embarked at waterford on 10 november. the officers were aggrieved that col colby had bypassed them and taken the proposal to extend the irish service direct to the other ranks. some of his subordinates attempted to have him court-martialled. colby resigned and lt-col william scourfield became commandant. in may 1800 the regiment went into camp on maker heights as part of the plymouth garrison, under the second-in-command, maj john lloyd. in common with other small welsh militia units, the pembrokeshires provided men to assist the gunners in the redoubts protecting the naval dockyard. having supplied numbers of volunteers to the line regiments, the pembrokeshires were now down to 170 men out of an establishment of 370, reduced to 201 in 1802 as the war came to a conclusion. after winter quarters in carmarthen the regiment was back in haverfordwest when the treaty of amiens was signed on 25 march 1802. the pembrokeshire militia was disembodied there early in april. napoleonic wars however, the peace of amiens was shortlived and the regiment was embodied again on 25 march 1803. it was now under lt-col owen philipps who had become commandant on 2 july 1802. however, he joined the regiment late, and it was marched from haverfordwest to chelmsford, essex, under maj john mathias in mid-may. it then established regimental headquarters (hq) at colchester with detachments across essex, and was brought up to strength by a draft of supplementary militiamen. for several years, the regiment had informally used the title of royal pembrokeshire militia: on 23 april 1804 this was made official when, along with 11 other welsh militia regiments, it was granted the 'royal' prefix. the hq remained at colchester until the summer of 1806, when the detachments were called in and the regiment concentrated at maldon before joining the harwich garrison. in june 1808 the regiment transferred to the bristol garrison. the following month the royal pembrokeshires (except one man) volunteered to be attached to the 43rd (monmouthshire) light infantry for service with sir john moore in the peninsular war in spain. although the offer was not taken up, the regiment was thanked by both the secretary at war and king george iii. it was about this time that the regiment was redesignated the royal pembroke fuzileers (fusiliers). in may 1809 the royal pembroke fusiliers marched to hastings in sussex, and then on to bexhill-on-sea, where it joined the welsh militia brigade, which also included the royal flint and royal merioneth militia. this brigade was dispersed in january 1810 and the regiment , now greatly understrength after supplying numerous volunteers to the line regiments, went to playden barracks near rye and then back to bristol with a detachment at milford haven in pembrokeshire. the regiment was redesignated the royal pembroke light infantry on 30 march 1810; as well as a change in training the drums were replaced by bugles and the sergeants' spontoons by light flintlock fusils. ireland 1811-12 in january 1811 and again in june the regiment, still at bristol, volunteered to serve in ireland, or in the peninsula if required. it embarked for ireland on 8 september. meanwhile, on 17 july 1811 it had received another new designation: it was now the royal pembrokeshire rifle corps (or simply royal pembroke rifles). this entailed a change of uniform and eventually of weaponry, the baker rifle and sword bayonet replacing the brown bess smoothbore musket and socket bayonet. by april 1812 the regiment was stationed at ballinasloe, about from athlone. the country was disturbed, with frequent acts of terrorism and attacks on soldiers. in may it moved to antrim, with half the regiment detached to carrickfergus. at the end of its tour of duty, the regiment marched to dundalk about 21 april 1813 and sailed to liverpool. it then marched back to pembrokeshire, reaching haverfordwest on 17 june. it remained there, with a detachment at milford haven, for the rest of the war, supplying volunteers to reinforce the regulars. napoleon abdicated on 6 april 1814, ending the war, and the royal pembroke rifles was disembodied on 24 june. unlike some other regiments, it was not re-embodied when napoleon escaped from elba and initiated the short waterloo campaign. long peace after waterloo there was another long peace. although officers continued to be commissioned into the militia and ballots were still occasionally held, the regiments were rarely assembled for training (only in 1818, 1821 and 1831) and the permanent staffs of sergeants and drummers were progressively reduced. however, the regimental band remained active, paid for privately by the officers. 1852 reforms the long-standing national militia of the united kingdom was revived by the militia act 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. as before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the militia ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21-28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. under the act, militia units could be embodied by royal proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances: 'whenever a state of war exists between her majesty and any foreign power'. 'in all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. 'in all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. he 1852 act introduced artillery militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the royal artillery (ra) for active service. one of the regiments chosen for conversion to artillery in 1853 was the royal pembroke rifles, which became the royal pembroke artillery militia. it was given an establishment of 431 all ranks, organised into four batteries, but for several years the numbers recruited were barely half that many. crimean war and after war having broken out with russia in 1854 and an expeditionary force sent to the crimea, the militia began to be called out for home defence. the royal monmouth light infantry (rmli) were embodied in may and stationed at pembroke dock, where they volunteered for overseas garrison service. the non-commissioned officers (ncos) and men of the royal pembroke artillery, not yet embodied, made the same offer. the regiment was assembled for its first 28-day training at haverfordwest on 12 june, but it was not until 30 january 1855 that it was embodied for permanent service, with 200 gunners enrolled, together with a small band of german musicians. the regiment began a period of intensive training in the milford haven defences. in august it took over security duties at pembroke dock from the royal marines, and in august no 1 company with detachment of the other companies took up duties with the ra on thorne island. work on a fort on this island had begun in 1852, and by 1855 it was armed with nine 68-pounder smoothbore muzzle-loading guns mounted on traversing carriages, sited to created a crossfire with dale fort to deny the entrance of the haven to hostile ships. just before christmas 1855, a severe storm cut thorne island off from the mainland and supplies ran out. however, the commanding officer and surgeon of the rmli at pembroke dock chartered a small steamer, and got close enough to throw some supplies onto the landing stage on the island. in april 1856 the other three companies of the royal pembroke artillery moved into pembroke dock from haverfordwest and provided gun detachments to man the gun towers round the royal navy dockyard and other forts around the haven. it also provide a number of volunteers who transferred to the ra. the treaty of paris signed on 30 march 1856 brought the war to an end, and in july the royal pembroke artillery returned to haverfordwest and was disembodied. the regiment returned to the normal system of annual training in 1857. it volunteered for duty in 1858 during the indian mutiny but the offer was not taken up. royal carmarthen and pembroke artillery in 1861 the war office decided to amalgamate the small welsh county militia contingents into larger regiments. the decision was made to convert the royal carmarthen rifles to artillery and amalgamate it with the understrength royal pembroke artillery. in june 1861 the royal carmarthen and pembroke artillery militia came into being. the two contingents retained their hqs and stores at carmarthen and haverfordwest, the pembroke establishment being set at 384 gunners organised into four batteries. sir hugh owen remained joint lt-col-cmdt with sir james williams-drummond, 3rd baronet, of the carmarthens. there is no record of the carmarthen and pembroke contingents training together. the pembroke militia quota (384 men) was increased to 436 in 1868, and by that date the enrolled strength was 434. in 1871 the royal pembroke artillery regained its independence and title, with 432 effectives out of a new establishment of 526 men.. royal pembroke artillery the militia reserve introduced in 1867 consisted of present and former militiamen who undertook to serve overseas in case of war. from 1871 the militia came under the war office rather than their county lords lieutenant. around a third of the recruits and many young officers went on to join the regular army. following the cardwell reforms a mobilisation scheme began to appear in the army list from december 1875. this assigned places in an order of battle of the 'garrison army' to militia artillery units: the royal pembroke artillery's war station was at pembroke, including stack rock fort, south hook fort, popton fort, fort hubberstone, west blockhouse fort, thorne island, scoveston fort, mumbles (swansea) and st catherine's fort (tenby). the royal artillery and militia artillery were reorganised on 14 april 1882, when 11 territorial divisions of garrison artillery were formed, each consisting of a number of brigades. in each division the 1st brigade was composed of regular ra batteries, the others being a varying number of militia corps. the royal pembroke artillery joined the welsh division, becoming 4th brigade, welsh division, ra, with four batteries. (all the militia artillery continued to use their old titles unofficially.) on 1 july 1889 the territorial divisions were reorganised into three large divisions of garrison artillery, the welsh militia units joining the western division and regaining their county titles (without any 'royal' prefixes, though these were unofficially retained). in april 1885 the pembroke brigade's hq moved from haverfordwest to fort hubberstone. this had been built in 1863-5 as an addition to the milford haven defences. sited on a headland it commanded excellent views of the entrance to the haven. it consisted of a defensible barracks with 28 guns and accommodation for 250 men. the original guns were probably 9-inch rifled muzzle-loading (rml) guns, but by 1872 eight rml 7-inch guns on moncrieff disappearing carriages had been added. in 1881 the armament consisted of a number of 10-inch guns in barbette mountings. by 1885 the enrolled strength of the pembroke artillery had fallen to 319, 206 short of establishment: moving the hq from a town to an isolated coastal fort had a detrimental effect on recruitment, and the unit never again reached full strength. however, the welsh militia artillery often carried out their annual training at the same time, so the batteries around the haven could cooperate in live-firing exercises against target vessels, and with the searchlights and defensive mines operated by the royal engineers. in may 1894 the pembroke, carmarthen, and cardigan artillery carried out combined night firing from hubberstone, popton and south hook forts respectively, and the following year all three units trained together at popton. the ra was divided into field and garrison branches in 1899, with all the militia and volunteer units becoming part of the royal garrison artillery (rga). the rga's divisional structure was abolished in 1902, when the unit became the pembroke royal garrison artillery (militia). during the second boer war the militia reservists were called out in november 1899 to reinforce the regulars. then the pembroke artillery was embodied from 4 may to 3 october 1900 for home defence. no only did it man hubberstone fort, but detachments went to hakin, milford haven and thorne island. disbandment after the boer war, the future of the militia was called into question. there were moves to reform the auxiliary forces (militia, yeomanry and volunteers) to take their place in the six army corps proposed by st john brodrick as secretary of state for war. some batteries of militia artillery were to be converted to field artillery. however, little of brodrick's scheme was carried out. under the sweeping haldane reforms of 1908, the militia was replaced by the special reserve, a semi-professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for regular units serving overseas in wartime. although all seven officers and 125 out of 184 other ranks of the pembroke rga (m) accepted transfer to the special reserve royal field artillery, as the pembroke royal field reserve artillery on 5 july 1908, it was disbanded on 16 march 1909. commanders the following officers commanded the regiment: commandants

colours when the regiment was inspected in 1684 the colour of the horse troop's cornet was unrecorded, but it bore a scroll inscribed 'for god and the king'. in 1759 the regiment carried two regimental colours in addition to the king's colour, a most unusual arrangement. both of these colours were blue, one carrying the coat of arms of pembrokeshire, the other those of haverfordwest. by 1808 the (single) regimental colour was garter blue appropriate to a royal regiment: it bore the union flag in the canton canton and in the centre was a union wreath of roses, thistles and shamrocks encircling the title 'royal pembroke fuziliers' with the prince of wales's feathers, coronet and 'ich dien' motto above.the regiment ceased to carry colours when converted to a rifle corps in 1811, and the last pair carried were laid up in st mary's church, haverfordwest, in 1909. uniforms and insignia from about 1759 the regiment wore a red uniform with blue facings. when converted to a rifle corps it adopted a rifle green uniform with black facings similar to the rifle brigade. on conversion to artillery in 1852 the regiment adopted the blue uniform with red facings of the ra. about 1800 the regiment wore a universal shako plate without regimental distinctions. an officer's epaulette of about 1811 carries as a badge the prince of wales's feathers, coronet and motto with a scroll beneath inscribed 'royal pembroke'. after conversion to artillery, the regiment wore the standard ra helmet plate of the royal arms over a gun, the scroll beneath reading 'militia artillery', changed to 'welsh division' in 1882. an embroidered title reading 'welsh' was worn on both shoulder straps 1882-89. after 1889 the scroll on the helmet plate read 'royal pembroke'. from 1901 the letter 'm' (for militia) appeared between the gun and the lower scroll. about 1860 the badge on the officers' pouchbelt plate consisted of the prince of wales's feathers, coronet and motto inside a crowned garter inscribed 'royal pembroke'. on khaki service dress the brass shoulder title read 'rga' over 'pembroke' and the cap badge was that of the ra with 'm' between the gun and the scroll. the officers' field service cap badge was an embroidered 'bomb' over a scroll reading 'royal pembroke'. precedence in 1759 it was ordered that militia regiments on service were to take precedence from the date of their arrival in camp. in 1760 this was altered to a system of drawing lots where regiments did duty together. during the war of american independence and french revolutionary war the counties were given an order of precedence determined by ballot each year. however, counties like pembrokeshire with no more than two companies were ignored. another ballot for precedence took place in 1803 at the start of the napoleonic war and remained in force until 1833: pembrokeshire was 54th. in 1833 the king drew the lots for individual regiments and the resulting list continued in force with minor amendments until 1855. the regiments raised before the peace of 1763 took the first 47 places and the royal pembroke rifles became 28th. the first artillery militia units formed were given an order of precedence in 1855 based on alphabetical order: the royal pembroke was 24th, which happened to be the same as the royal carmarthen's precedence as an infantry regiment. the combined regiment used this precedence 1861-71; after it split the royal carmarthen retained the precedence of 24th among artillery militia units but the royal pembroke dropped to 31st. see also trained bands militia (english)

       " 'cabaret red light was a theater group based in philadelphia that performed vaudeville, burlesque, spoken word and puppet theater, set to original music by the blazing cherries. in their first season, between november 2008 and july 2009, cabaret red light staged the series \"the seven deadly sins\". their second and third series (\"the experiment\", about a cabaret that builds a time machine, and \"the seven deadly seas\", a pirate and gypsy-jazz show aboard the barquentine gazela) began in 2010, and they recently performed the premiere of their ballet-and-burlesque version of the nutcracker based on e. t. a. hoffmann\\'s original gothic short story \"the nutcracker and the mouse king.\" cabaret red light\\'s shows have been described as a blend of agitprop and burlesque, an unlikely combination that earned them the title \"the best marxist girlie show in hell.\" in their third show in the seven sins series, wrath!, the group handed out pamphlets announcing the emergence worldwide of \"pornographic socialism.\" in the finale of their fifth show, gluttony!, they immersed a showgirl (annie a-bomb) in liquid chocolate and invited members of the audience to lick it off. when holly otterbein of philadelphia city paper asked co-director peter gaffney about the politics of the show, he responded, \"the common ways in which we entertain ourselves — tv, movies, the internet — involve sitting in a room by yourself. compare that to the licking scene. it\\'s the opposite. it\\'s real people in a room experimenting with themselves and testing out their own limits.\" in other interviews, however, gaffney has denied that cabaret red light has any overtly political agenda. \"we think that theater has no business being in politics,\" he stated in an interview with

that politically engaged theater, on the other hand, is serious to a fault. their influences include anita berber, nsk (the neue slowenische kunst political art collective), georges brassens, kurt weill, bulat okudzawa, bertolt brecht, aristophanes and wilhelm reich, as well as more contemporary artists and performance groups such as julie atlas muz, les yeux noirs, frank zappa, bread and puppet theater, tom waits, the yes men and the yard dogs road show. in november 2008 they performed their first show, \"vanity\" as part of \" the seven deadly sins\" series at l\\'etage cabaret in philadelphia. beginning in november, 2009, plays and players theatre began presenting cabaret red light\\'s shows derived from their cabaret material. these shows were called \"the takeover\", \"the occupation\", and \"lust\". these elaborately staged productions have included such things as an army of showgirls armed with feathers and weapon props, and a 20-foot octopus puppet. in the summers of 2010 and 2011 the company produced four shows in the series, \"the seven deadly seas\". the shows were about pirates as corporate/capitalist figures and featured swordplay and burlesque. they premiered on the gazela, a historic three masted tall ship. shows were performed in philadelphia, new york, and baltimore. their original production of nutcracker premiered in december 2010 at painted bride art center in philadelphia. the show featured an original adaptation of the original e. t. a. hoffmann story by peter gaffney and anna frangiosa. music by rolf lakamper. choreography by christine fisler. the adaptation was for adults and featured ballet, shadow puppetry, burlesque, and a seven piece orchestra. the production was re-mounted in december 2011 and sold out all performances. in october 2011 cabaret red light produced an original musical play inspired by mae west titled, \"looking pretty and saying cute things\". written by anna frangiosa and peter gaffney. music direction by chris ashman. inspired by mae west\\'s early brushes with the law over obscenity, her imprisonment for eight days after an \"obscenity conviction\", and her censuring by the hays code. cabaret red light produced no shows in 2012. the company\\'s website had not been updated since 2011. see also anna frangiosa the cabaret administration jubilee! peepshow sirens of ti absinthe

       " 'greek lyric is the body of lyric poetry written in dialects of ancient greek. it is primarily associated with the early 7th to the early 5th centuries bc, sometimes called the \"lyric age of greece\", but continued to be written into the hellenistic and imperial periods. background lyric is one of three broad categories of poetry in classical antiquity, along with drama and epic, according to the scheme of the \"natural forms of poetry\" developed by goethe in the early nineteenth century. (drama is considered a form of poetry here because both tragedy and comedy were written in verse in ancient greece.) culturally, greek lyric is the product of the political, social and intellectual milieu of the greek polis (\"city-state\"). much of greek lyric is occasional poetry, composed for public or private performance by a soloist or chorus to mark particular occasions. the symposium (\"drinking party\") was one setting in which lyric poems were performed. \"lyric\" was sometimes sung to the accompaniment of either a string instrument (particularly the lyre or kithara) or a wind instrument (most often the reed pipe called aulos). whether the accompaniment was a string or wind instrument, the term for such accompanied lyric was melic poetry (from the greek word for \"song\" melos). lyric could also be sung without any instrumental accompaniment. this latter form is called meter and it is recited rather than sung, strictly speaking. modern surveys of \"greek lyric\" often include relatively short poems composed for similar purposes or circumstances that were not strictly \"song lyrics\" in the modern sense, such as elegies and iambics. the greeks themselves did not include elegies nor iambus within melic poetry, since they had different metres and different musical instruments. the edinburgh companion to ancient greece and rome offers the following clarification: \"\\'melic\\' is a musical definition, \\'elegy\\' is a metrical definition, whereas \\'iambus\\' refers to a genre and its characteristics subject matter. (...) the fact that these categories are artificial and potentially misleading should prompt us to approach greek lyric poetry with an open mind, without preconceptions about what \\'type\\' of poetry we are reading.\" greek lyric poems celebrate athletic victories (epinikia), commemorate the dead, exhort soldiers to valor, and offer religious devotion in the forms of hymns, paeans, and dithyrambs. partheneia, \"maiden-songs,\" were sung by choruses of maidens at festivals. love poems praise the beloved, express unfulfilled desire, proffer seductions, or blame the former lover for a breakup. in this last mood, love poetry might blur into invective, a poetic attack aimed at insulting or shaming a personal enemy, an art at which archilochus, the earliest known greek lyric poet, excelled. the themes of greek lyric include \"politics, war, sports, drinking, money, youth, old age, death, the heroic past, the gods,\" and hetero- and homosexual love. in the 3rd century bc, the encyclopedic movement at alexandria produced a canon of the nine melic poets: alcaeus, alcman, anacreon, bacchylides, ibycus, pindar, sappho, simonides, and stesichorus. only a small sampling of lyric poetry from archaic greece, the period when it first flourished, survives. for example, the poems of sappho are said to have filled nine papyrus rolls in the library of alexandria, with the first book alone containing more than 1,300 lines of verse. today, only one of sappho\\'s poems exists intact, with fragments from other sources that would scarcely fill a chapbook. meters greek poetry meters are based on patterns of long and short syllables (in contrast to english verse, which is determined by stress), and lyric poetry is characterized by a great variety of metrical forms. apart from the shift between long and short syllables, stress must be considered when reading greek poetry. the interplay between the metric \"shifts\", the stressed syllables and caesuras is an integral part of the poetry. it allows the poet to stress certain words and shape the meaning of the poem. there are two main divisions within the meters of ancient greek poetry: lyric and non-lyric meters. \"lyric meters (literally, meters sung to a lyre) are usually less regular than non-lyric meters. the lines are made up of feet of different kinds, and can be of varying lengths. some lyric meters were used for monody (solo songs), such as some of the poems of sappho and alcaeus; others were used for choral dances, such as the choruses of tragedies and the victory odes of pindar.\" the lyric meters\\' families are the ionic, the aeolic (based on the choriamb, which can generate varied kinds of verse, such as the glyconian or the sapphic stanza), and the dactylo-epitrite. the doric choral songs were composed in complex triadic forms of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, with the first two parts of the triad having the same metrical pattern, and the epode a different form. bibliography translations anthologies . . . loeb classical library . . . . . . . critical editions lyric . . . . . elegy and iambus . . scholarship . . . — translated from the french original of 1977 by d. collins & j. orion. . da cunha corrêa, p.

       " 'the ornate wobbegong (orectolobus ornatus) is a species of carpet shark that lives in australia and possibly other countries in the western pacific ocean. it is coloured golden brown, yellow-green and blueish-grey, and it grows to maximum . described by charles walter de vis in 1883, it is similar in appearance to other australian wobbegongs and has previously been classified as the same species as the gulf wobbegong. it is a nocturnal species, hunting at night, and it can bite humans when disturbed. the international union for conservation of nature has listed it as a least-concern species. taxonomy the ornate wobbegong was described by charles walter de vis in 1883. it was previously assumed to be the juvenile form of the gulf wobbegong (orectolobus halei), due to similarities between the two species. however, there are multiple differences: for example, the ornate wobbegong is smaller, has a smaller head relative to its body, and is less freckled. \"banded wobbegong\" is an alternative common name for the ornate wobbegong; however, it is also used for the gulf wobbegong. description the ornate wobbegong\\'s upperside is golden brown in colour with blueish-grey areas, and it is yellow-green on its underside. it has two dorsal fins, a large flat head, and small eyes. its mouth and lower head are covered with flaps of skin. juveniles are in total length and sexual maturity is reached at . for adults, the maximum reported size is . the ornate wobbegong is similar in appearance to the gulf wobbegong and the spotted wobbegong (orectolobus maculatus). however, it is smaller than the former and it does not have the distinctive o-shaped spots of the latter. the ornate wobbegong also has markings with black edges, further differentiating it from the spotted wobbegong. its distinct colour pattern provides good camouflage: it is barely discernible when amidst plants on the sea floor. as specimens grow older, however, this pattern becomes less prominent. ecology the ornate wobbegong is a nocturnal species, with most activity and feeding taking place in the nighttime. in the daytime, it has occasionally been known to hunt for food, but generally it is in a \"somewhat sleepy state\", resting out in the open or under caves and ledges, often on sand or weed bottoms. habitats include algae-covered sea floors, coral reefs, or bays. the species usually lives in clearer waters than the spotted wobbegong. its prey consists of crustaceans, fish, and octopuses. a study of the diet of specimens in port jackson showed that fish, primarily luderick, moray eels, and snappers, composed 86.5% of the species\\' diet, and cephalopods composed 13.5% of it. reproduction is ovoviviparous and over 12 pups are born at a time. gestation takes almost a year, with young hatching in september or october. a one-day-old specimen was observed by neville coleman to have a full set of teeth and be able to defend itself. the ornate wobbegong is usually not hostile towards humans, but it can bite when disturbed. it uses its sharp anterior teeth to inflict \"shallow but painful wounds\". because it camouflages so well, divers often fail to see it even when they are close, and some are bitten. it has bitten people who go into tide pools, including fishers and waders. it sometimes swims towards nearby divers, possibly with hostile intent. the international shark attack file has recorded 32 attacks by wobbegongs species in general because it is difficult to do an accurate identification of wobbegongs. distribution the ornate wobbegong lives in tropical and warm temperate waters no deeper than . it is native to eastern australia, in the western pacific ocean. reports have been confirmed at port stephens and sydney. although it has also been reported to live in indonesia, japan, and papua new guinea, the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) states that these reports probably misidentified other fish for this species, which would make the ornate wobbegong endemic to australia. however, according to the florida museum of natural history, it does live in indonesia and papua new guinea. this report has to be verified. the ornate wobbegong\\'s population is not known, nor whether it is increasing or decreasing. its main threat in eastern australia is commercial fishing. a survey from may 2000 to april 2001 concluded that 5,174 total wobbegongs (including other species) were fished and kept in new south wales, queensland, south australia, and western australia. its flesh is edible, which makes it a target for human consumption, and its skin has previously been utilised for decoration. it is not threatened currently, as it is only caught in parts of its range and not often. as of 20 february 2015, it is listed as a least-concern species on the iucn red list, after two assessments as near threatened in 2003 and 2009. references external links banded wobbegong @ fishes of australia ornate wobbegong marine fish of eastern australia ornate wobbegong taxa named by charles walter de vis',\n",

       " 'a ban on sharia law is legislation that prohibits the application or implementation of islamic law (sharia) in courts in any civil (non-religious) jurisdiction. in the united states for example, various states have \"banned sharia law,\" or a ballot measure was passed that \"prohibits the state\\'s courts from considering foreign, international or religious law.\" these include alabama, arizona, kansas, louisiana, north carolina, south dakota and tennessee. in the canadian province of ontario, family law disputes are arbitrated only under ontario law. united states constitutional prohibitions and accommodations because of the establishment clause of the united states constitution, no religious tradition can be established as the basis of laws that apply to everyone, including any form of sharia, christian canon law, jewish halakha, or rules of dharma from indian religions. laws must be passed in a secular fashion, not by religious authorities. the free exercise clause allows residents to practice any religion or no religion, and there is often controversy about separation of church and state and the balance between these two clauses when the government does or does not accommodate any particular religious practice (for example blue laws that require stores to be closed on sunday, the christian holy day). direct consultation of any religious law, including any form of sharia, is relatively rare in u.s. jurisprudence and is generally limited to circumstances where the government is accommodating the religious belief of a specific person. this occurs mainly in matters of arbitration and family law. for example, the law may allow parties to submit a dispute for binding arbitration to a mutually agreed-upon religious authority; mandatory arbitration by a specified or mutually-agreed arbitrator is also a common clause in commercial and labor union contracts. couples with the same religious beliefs may wish to construct marriage contracts and conduct divorces in concordance with those beliefs, and people may also wish to arrange wills and other financial matters in accordance with their own religious principles. if presented as evidence, devotion to peaceful religious principles, along with many other aspects of personality, is commonly considered when judging the character of a person before the law, for example during sentencing or a parole hearing. despite the free exercise clause, the 1878 supreme court decision in reynolds v. united states (which concerned the conflict of the mormon practice of polygamy with anti-bigamy laws) affirmed that secular laws still apply when they contradict religious practices, unless a superseding law establishes a right to a religious accommodation. the american bar association has opposed legislation banning foreign law or sharia as unnecessary, given that existing safeguards against foreign law already protect against rules that are contrary to american foreign policy, including discrimination on the basis of gender and religion. background of controversy in june 2009, a family court judge in hudson county, new jersey denied a restraining order to a woman who testified that her husband, a muslim, had raped her. the judge said he did not believe the man \"had a criminal desire to or intent to sexually assault\" his wife because he was acting in a way that was \"consistent with his practices.\" a state appeals court reversed his decision. advocates of the ban in the u.s. have cited this case as an example of the need for the ban. as of 2014, more than two dozen u.s. states have considered measures intended to restrict judges from consulting sharia law. arizona, kansas, louisiana, south dakota, tennessee, north carolina, and alabama have \"banned sharia,\"i.e., passed foreign law bans. in 2010 and 2011, more than two dozen states \"considered measures to restrict judges from consulting shariah, or foreign and religious laws more generally\". as of 2013, all but 16 states have considered such a law. in november 2010, voters in oklahoma approved a ballot measure to amend the state constitution to ban sharia from state courts. the law was then updated to include all foreign or religious laws. the law was challenged by an official of the council on american-islamic relations. in november 2010 a federal judge ruled the law to be unconstitutional and blocked the state from putting it into effect. the court found the ban had the potential to do harm to muslims. the invalidation of a will and testament using sharia instructions was an example. that ruling and injunction were upheld by the tenth circuit court of appeals on january 10, 2012. missouri also passed a measure banning foreign law in 2013, but gov. jay nixon vetoed the bill \"because of its potential impact on international adoptions.\" two other states banning sharia were north carolina, which prohibited state judges from considering islamic law in family cases in 2013, and alabama, where voters passed an amendment to the state constitution (72% to 28%) to \"ban sharia\" in 2014. supporters david yerushalmi has been called the founder of the movement in america and is described by the new york times as \"working with a cadre of conservative public-policy institutes and former military and intelligence officials\" and to pass legislation, \"a network of tea party and christian groups\" as well as act! for america. this has been linked to the counter-jihad movement\\'s efforts, along with legal campaigns to oppose mosque constructions across the us. according to him, the purpose of the anti-sharia movement is not to pass legislation banning sharia law in the courts but \"to get people asking this question, ‘what is shariah?\\'\". in 2011, republicans sarah palin, newt gingrich and michele bachmann warned about what they saw as the threat of sharia law. during the lead-up to newt gingrich\\'s presidential campaign 2012, he described sharia law as a \"mortal threat\" and called for its ban throughout america. sarah palin has been quoted as saying that if shariah law \"were to be adopted, allowed to govern in our country, it will be the downfall of america.\" at a press conference in the u.s. capitol, some republican members of the united states congress endorsed a new memorandum, based on a center for security policy (csp) report, shariah: the threat to america. analysis a 2013 report by the brennan center for justice warned that the bans may have the unintended effects of invalidating prenuptial agreements and court decisions made in other states where arbitrators may have taken into account islamic, jewish or catholic legal norms. randy brinson, the president of the christian coalition of alabama, criticized the ban in alabama, calling it \"redundant and a waste of time\". historian justin tyler clark argues that the rise of an anti-sharia movement in the us, more than a decade after the september 11 attacks, is in part a reaction to increasing political correctness in the american society. clark compares the phenomenon to the 19th century anti-catholic movement in the us, which, he writes, rose largely in reaction to changes in middle-class american etiquette, interpreted by the nativists as encroachment of an alien ideology on their own social norms. according to sadakat kadri, the ban on sharia laws notwithstanding, \"the precepts of islamic law ... have judicial force in the united states already\", among muslims who have had a dispute settled by muslim conciliators. the 1925 federal arbitration act allows muslims, christians, jews, etc. to use religious tribunals to arbitrate disagreements and \"the judgments that result are given force of law by state and federal courts\". the statute \"preempts inconsistent state legislation\", such as laws to ban sharia. for american jews who choose to obey its rulings, a beth din (rabbinical court) \"may not merely decide the legal rights of devout jews; in some cases, it may formally forbid believers from pursuing complaints through the secular judicial system without prior authorization from a rabbi. and muslims can also have their inheritance, business, and matrimonial disputes sorted out by islamic scholars, who attempt to decide them according to the sharia.\" while the us congress could in theory repeal the act, it could not ban arbitration by muslims while leaving other religious conciliators free to continue their work. \"any reform would have to impact equally on all faith communities, and it is not only muslims who would object if federal legislators presumed to do that.\" canada in 2003-2004, there was a controversy in ontario over the possibility of islamic arbitration tribunals. in 1991, ontario had passed the arbitration act, which allowed for legal mediation and arbitration outside of canadian family law. some christian and jewish groups conducted religious arbitration in accordance with this law; this did not cause controversy. in 2003, an islamic group declared its intention to set up similar faith-based arbitration, provoking intense media controversy. as a result, the ontario government commissioned marion boyd (the former attorney general of ontario) to review the matter. boyd conducted consultations and concluded that religious tribunals be continued, but should be overseen by other institutions. public opinion was against both boyd\\'s report and potential islamic tribunals. as a result, in 2006, the province of ontario banned all forms of faith-based arbitrations. as this decision also banned rabbinical courts, it was criticized by canadian jewish groups. in 2005, the national assembly of quebec passed a motion to prevent the use of islamic courts in quebec. western europe united kingdom in the united kingdom, sharia has also become a political issue. a \"one law for all\" campaign seeks to ban sharia councils and arguing this is \"the only way to end discrimination suffered by muslim women\". in 2015, the conservative party home secretary theresa may called for an investigation into the application of sharia law in england and wales if conservatives win the general election. a day later the mayor of london, boris johnson, told a radio interviewer, he was opposed to \"a sharia system running in parallel with uk justice.\" the issue arose in 2008, when the former archbishop of canterbury rowan williams \\'suggested it was \"inevitable\" that elements of sharia would be incorporated in british law.\\' since then, \"sharia courts\" have \"never been far from tabloid headlines\", according to myriam francois-cerrah. as of 2014, there were reported to be around 85 \"shariah courts\" in the uk, operated by two rival services - islamic sharia council and the newer, smaller, less strict muslim arbitration tribunal. the councils/tribunals provide arbitration that is voluntary but legally binding, are \"officially mandated\" and set up outside the court system like another non-secular arbitration institution, the longstanding rabbinical tribunals. the council/tribunals are defended as providing an essential service for pious muslims who would simply work with non-government mandated sharia councils if the government abolished the mandated ones. but they are also criticized for taking the man\\'s side in rulings, for example advising women to forfeit their mahr (marriage dower) in exchange for a divorce. according to legal historian sadakat kadri, the muslim arbitration tribunal has \"no jurisdiction over criminal matters or cases involving children.\" a uk-trained lawyer sits \"on all its panels, and every decision\" is subject to judicial review - \"meaning that it was subject to reversal if it disclosed unfair procedures, human rights violations, or any other step that ordinary court considered contrary to the public interest.\" according to kadri, british muslims neither know nor care about the criminal penalties of sharia law (tazir and hudud) but seek much less controversial services. in addition to the sharia law of the councils and tribunals, there have also been reports of \"vigilante sharia squads\" in some places, such as whitechapel, east london. the legal system of the united kingdom treats these squads as criminals. germany sharia law is part of germany\\'s private law through the regulations of the german international private law. its application is limited by the order public. in september 2014, a small group of muslims wearing mock police uniforms patrolled the streets of the western german city of wuppertal. they \"reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol\". following the incident the interior minister thomas de maizière told the daily newspaper bild, \"sharia law is not tolerated on german soil.\" the leader of the \"police\", salafist sven lau, responded by saying the \"sharia police\" \"never existed\" and he only wanted to \"raise attention\" to sharia. the central council of muslims in germany (zmd) condemned the activities. greece the issue of the supremacy of sharia has arisen in greece where a muslim woman (chatitze molla sali), has left her husband\\'s estate in his will (a greek document registered at a notary\\'s office) when he died in march 2008. her in-laws immediately challenged the bequest with the local mufti (a muslim jurist and theologian) in the name of sharia law, \"which forbids muslims to write wills\" (islamic law rather than the inheritee determining who gets what from the estate of the deceased). molla sali took the dispute to a civil court where she won, but in october 2013, the greek supreme court ruled against her and \"established that matters of inheritance among the muslim minority must be resolved by the mufti, following islamic laws\", in accordance with the 1923 treaty of lausanne between greece and turkey. sali has appealed the decision to the european court of human rights. muslim-majority countries although turkey is a muslim-majority country, since kemal atatürk\\'s reforms and the creation of the republic of turkey, sharia law was banned in 1924 and new westernized civil and penal codes were adopted in 1926. in tunisia, some forms of sharia law were reinterpreted. see also application of

       " 'a preliminary examination by the international criminal court (icc) to analyze possible crimes against humanity committed in venezuela is currently open. a preliminary examination was previously opened in 2006, but closed after concluding that the requirements to start an investigation had not been met. in february 2018, the icc announced that it would open preliminary probes into alleged crimes against humanity performed by venezuelan authorities since at least april 2017. in 2020, the office of the prosecutor of the icc stated that it believed there was a \"reasonable basis\" to believe that \"since at least april 2017, civilian authorities, members of the armed forces and pro-government individuals have committed the crimes against humanity\", and on 2021 icc prosecutor karim khan announced the opening of an investigation regarding the situation in the country. background by 2006, the office of the prosecutor received twelve communications concerning the situation in venezuela, most of them related to crimes allegedly committed by the venezuelan government and associated forces and one to crimes alleged to have been committed by opposition groups, but the examination was closed on 9 february 2006 because it was concluded that the rome statute requirements to seek authorization to initiate an investigation in the country had not been satisfied. preliminary examination 2018 in february 2018, the international criminal court (icc) announced that it would open preliminary probes into alleged crimes against humanity performed by venezuelan authorities. in may 2018, a panel of independent international experts appointed by the secretary general of the organization of american states (oas) concluded that reasonable grounds existed to believe that crimes against humanity had been committed in venezuela dating back to at least 12 february 2014 and recommended that; the secretary general of the oas, luis almagro, should submit the report and the evidence collected by the general secretariat of the oas to the office of the prosecutor of the icc, that he should invite states parties to the rome statute to refer the situation of venezuela to the office of the prosecutor and to call for the opening of an investigation into the facts set forth in the report, in accordance with article 14 of the rome statute. on 27 september 2018, six states parties to the rome statute: argentina, canada, colombia, chile, paraguay and peru, referred the situation in venezuela since 12 february 2014 to the icc, requesting the prosecutor fatou bensouda to initiate an investigation on crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the territory. on 28 september, the presidency assigned the situation to pre-trial chamber i. this was the first time that member states had sought an investigation of potential crimes that took place entirely on the territory of another country. 2020 nicolás maduro\\'s foreign minister, jorge arreaza, filed a complaint in the icc against the united states on 13 february 2020, arguing that policy of sanctions has resulted in crimes against humanity. prosecutor bensouda stated that she informed the icc presidency of the referral pursuant to the regulations of the court to enable the assignment of the situation to a pre-trial chamber, noting that the two referrals \"appear to overlap geographically and temporally and may therefore warrant assignment to the same pre-trial chamber\", but \"that this should not prejudice a later determination on whether the referred scope of the two situations is sufficiently linked to constitute a single situation\". in september 2020, the united nations independent international fact-finding mission on venezuela published their findings and cited evidence of unlawful executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture in the country since 2014. the authors called for further action by the international criminal court, along with justice and reparations for the victims and their families. on 2 december 2020, the organization of american states general secretariat released a 145-page report expanding on the 2018 report by the panel of independent experts that concluded there was a reasonable basis to believe crimes against humanity were being committed in venezuela, noting that since 2018 the crimes against humanity in venezuela had increased in scale, scope, and severity, while criticizing the failure of the prosecutor of the icc to conduct her preliminary examination expeditiously and to open an investigation \"despite overwhelming evidence of crimes within the court\\'s jurisdiction\". two days afterwards, the office of the prosecutor responded that it was aware and that it would study the organisation of american states report and assuring the office that it sought to \"complete preliminary examinations within the shortest time possible\", but regretting \"the tone and manner of the report\" and that prosecutor and the office \"would not allow external attempts\" to interfere with the process. oas secretary general luis almagro replied shortly after, declaring that the oas understood due process and that they had \"the utmost respect\" for the international criminal court, but that three years was far too long \"not for the oas\", but for the victims in venezuela. on 14 december, the office of the prosecutor released a report on the office\\'s year activities, stating that it believed there was a \"reasonable basis\" to believe that \"since at least april 2017, civilian authorities, members of the armed forces and pro-government individuals have committed the crimes against humanity.\" and that it expected to decide in 2021 whether to open an investigation or not. 2021 in may 2021, maduro\\'s attorney general, tarek william saab, admitted that fernando albán, caracas councilman who died in 2018 while he was detained in the headquarters of the bolivarian intelligence service (sebin), did not commit suicide as initially reported by government officials, but killed, and that during the 2017 venezuelan protests student juan pablo pernalete was killed with a tear gas canister by security forces, something initially denied by senior officials. william saab would also accuse the icc \"process of lacking transparency\". maduro\\'s vice president, delcy rodríguez, described the case against venezuela in the icc as a \"great farce\". the opposition national assembly headed by juan guaidó declared that william saab sought to prevent the icc from acting and condemned that command chain was not being investigated. on july 2, the pre-trial chamber dismissed a request for \"judicial control\" filed by william saab, who alleged a lack of complementarity and collaboration of the icc office of the prosecutor with venezuela. the chamber dismissed the appeal for its inadmissibility and for being clearly premature. on 4 november 2021 prosecutor karim khan announced the opening of an investigation regarding the situation in venezuela. investigation 2022 on 17 january 2022, the prosecutor\\'s office indicated that the administration of nicolás maduro had three months to submit its report on investigations into crimes against humanity committed in the country. on 7 april, tarek william saab assured that \"there is no need\" for an investigation by the international criminal court. after failing to provide the requested information, in an attempt to delay the icc investigation, venezuela asked karin khan on april 15 that his office defer the investigation into possible crimes against humanity, claiming that state institutions were or have investigated such crimes. on april 20, khan briefed a panel of icc judges on venezuela\\'s request, stating that his office would ask the judges to reject the request. on 1 november, karin khan requested the reopening of the venezuela investigation, just over six months after venezuela asked the icc to defer its investigation, stating that \"the deferral requested by venezuela, at this stage, is not justified, and that the resumption of the investigation should be authorized.\" in response to the prosecutor\\'s request, the venezuelan state sent a document on november 10, opposing the direct participation of victims and their representatives and requesting that the investigation be limited to summaries prepared by the icc\\'s office of public counsel for victims and only to cases presented by the office of the prosecutor. in the document, venezuela also asks the icc judges not to allow the participation in the proceedings of canada, colombia, chile, paraguay and peru, the member states that referred the situation of venezuela to the court. the ngo provea warned that the communiqué was part of the maduro government\\'s dilatory strategy to paralyze the icc prosecutor\\'s investigation for as long as possible, expressing: \"this communication ratifies the venezuelan authorities\\' contempt for the victims and their claims for justice, as well as their unwillingness to genuinely comply with the principle of complementarity\". 2023 on february 28, the venezuelan government issued a statement in which it described the accusations against it as \"fallacies\" and denied that crimes against humanity have occurred in the country, arguing that the investigation has had a \"political character\". the ngo control ciudadano warned that such actions by the maduro government sought to discredit the icc prosecutor\\'s office and that it was evidence that the international court should exercise its jurisdiction over the cases under its investigation. prosecutor karim khan responded to the allegations on march 1, stating in a statement that the government\\'s claim that no crimes against humanity had been committed was unsubstantiated and without sufficient evidence and that the venezuelan authorities had not demonstrated that investigations or trials had been conducted at the domestic level that reflected the scope of the court\\'s ongoing investigation. the pre-trial chamber asked venezuela to submit a response of no more than ten pages, with a deadline of april 20. on april 3, maduro\\'s government accused khan of \"instrumentalizing\" justice \"for political purposes\". on march 13, the international criminal court announced that it had received more than 2,000 forms from victims regarding the consultation on whether or not to continue the investigation. in view of the large number of testimonies received, the court extended the deadline for receiving forms from march 21 to april 20. on april 20, the court announced that the consultation process was \"broadly participatory\" and that applications included 8,900 victims, 630 families and two organizations. the victims participation and reparations section received 1,875 applications with their views and concerns, including 1,746 forms, 5 videos and 124 emails or other written documents. the information shared by the victims was compiled by the section in a 57-page report and published the following day. the report describes that the victims \"overwhelmingly\" requested that the court continue with the investigation, that the venezuelan justice system was unwilling to genuinely investigate human rights violations, and describes testimonies of arbitrary detentions, torture, rape and persecution. venezuelan foreign minister yván gil pinto asked the pre-trial chamber for time until may 30 to respond to the requests. the chamber rejected the request on may 8, ruling that it was not the procedural moment to do so and that at the current stage of the investigation no victim had yet been admitted to participate in the case. on april 24, the head of the pro-government delegation to the negotiations in mexico, jorge rodriguez, called for a halt to the investigation at the international criminal court, stating that one of the objectives of the dialogue with the opposition was to request a halt to the judicial proceedings against the country. on june 8, karim khan made a third visit to venezuela, where he met with maduro\\'s attorney general, tarek william saab. the meeting was held at the headquarters of the public prosecutor\\'s office in caracas and the local press did not have access to it. khan also met with gladys gutiérrez, president of the supreme tribunal of justice of venezuela, and privately with nicolás maduro at the miraflores presidential palace. human rights organizations questioned the opacity surrounding the visit. during the visit, the agreement to open an icc office in caracas was also confirmed, although without a specific public date. ali daniels, co-director of the ngo acceso a la justicia, argued that the installation of the office would not affect the course of the court\\'s investigation. non-governmental organizations requested that the facility agreement be made public. on june 27, the pre-trial chamber authorized prosecutor khan to continue investigations into crimes against humanity in venezuela. the chamber found that the domestic investigations in venezuela did not adequately address the magnitude of the case and had unwarranted periods of inactivity. maduro\\'s government appealed the decision on july 5, an appeal that was rejected by the court on july 21. see also human rights in venezuela international criminal court and the 2003 invasion of iraq references international reactions to the crisis in venezuela venezuela',\n",

       " 'pragmatic general multicast (pgm) is a reliable multicast computer network transport protocol. pgm provides a reliable sequence of packets to multiple recipients simultaneously, making it suitable for applications like multi-receiver file-transfer. multicast is a network addressing method for the delivery of information to a group of destinations simultaneously using the most efficient strategy to deliver the messages over each link of the network only once, creating copies only when the links to the multiple destinations split (typically network switches and routers). however, like the user datagram protocol, multicast does not guarantee the delivery of a message stream. messages may be dropped, delivered multiple times, or delivered out of order. a reliable multicast protocol, like pgm, adds the ability for receivers to detect lost and/or out-of-order messages and take corrective action (similar in principle to tcp), resulting in a gap-free, in-order message stream. while tcp uses acks to acknowledge groups of packets sent (something that would be uneconomical over multicast), pgm uses the concept of negative acknowledgements (naks). a nak is sent unicast back to the host via a defined network-layer hop-by-hop procedure whenever there is a detection of data loss of a specific sequence. as pgm is heavily reliant on naks for integrity, when a nak is sent, a nak confirmation (ncf) is sent via multicast for every hop back. repair data (rdata) is then sent back either from the source or from a designated local repairer (dlr) at some point closer to the destination. pgm is an ietf experimental protocol. it is not yet a standard, but has been implemented in some networking devices and operating systems, including windows xp and later versions of microsoft windows, as well as in third-party libraries for linux, windows and solaris. external links https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3208 https://github.com/steve-o/openpgm/ https://web.archive.org/web/20110111200232/http://www.cisco.com/en/us/docs/ios/12_0t/12_0t5/feature/guide/pgmscale.html communications protocols',\n",

       " 'a website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. the term wireframe is taken from other fields that use a skeletal framework to represent 3 dimensional shape and volume. wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. the purpose is usually driven by a business objective and a creative idea. the wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website\\'s content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together. the wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content. in other words, it focuses on what a screen does, not what it looks like. wireframes can be pencil drawings or sketches on a whiteboard, or they can be produced by means of a broad array of free or commercial software applications. wireframes are generally created by business analysts, user experience designers, developers, visual designers, and by those with expertise in interaction design, information architecture and user research. wireframes focus on: the range of functions available the relative priorities of the information and functions the rules for displaying certain kinds of information the effect of different scenarios on the display the website wireframe connects the underlying conceptual structure, or information architecture, to the surface, or visual design of the website. wireframes help establish functionality and the relationships between different screen templates of a website. an iterative process, creating wireframes is an effective way to make rapid prototypes of pages, while measuring the practicality of a design concept. wireframing typically begins between \"high-level structural work—like flowcharts or site maps—and screen designs.\" within the process of building a website, wireframing is where thinking becomes tangible. wireframes are also utilized for the prototyping of mobile sites, computer applications, or other screen-based products that involve human-computer interaction. uses of wireframes wireframes may be utilized by different disciplines. developers use wireframes to get a more tangible grasp of the site\\'s functionality, while designers use them to push the user interface (ui) process. user experience designers and information architects use wireframes to show navigation paths between pages. business analysts use wireframes to visually support the business rules and interaction requirements for a screen. business stakeholders review wireframes to ensure that requirements and objectives are met through the design. professionals who create wireframes include business analysts, information architects, interaction designers, user experience designers, graphic designers, programmers, and product managers. working with wireframes may be a collaborative effort since it bridges the information architecture to the visual design. due to overlaps in these professional roles, conflicts may occur, making wireframing a controversial part of the design process. since wireframes signify a \"bare bones\" aesthetic, it is difficult for designers to assess how closely the wireframe needs to depict actual screen layouts. to avoid conflicts it is recommended that business analysts who understand the user requirements, create a basic wire frame and then work with designers to further improve the wireframes. another difficulty with wireframes is that they don\\'t effectively display interactive details because they are static representations. modern ui design incorporates various devices such as expanding panels, hover effects, and carousels that pose a challenge for 2-d diagrams. the main benefit of wireframes is that they can be used to iterate on any interface in an agile manner. this happens through a process oftentimes referred to as usability tests, where users are provided with an opportunity to interact with the interface and either think aloud about their thought process or answer more structured questions throughout. after each trial with a user, a user experience researcher can identify common interactions with the interface, synthesize the data, and redesign accordingly. due to the generally lower-fidelity nature of wireframe, it is very easy and cost-efficient to make changes. the point of a wireframe is to capture the design of the fundamental structure, high-level interaction pattern within an interface, otherwise known as the critical points, so it really allows a designer to work quickly, perfect for an agile environment where group members work collaboratively to \"sprint\" to the next iteration. wireframes may have different levels of detail and can be broken up into two categories in terms of fidelity, or how closely they resemble the end product. low-fidelity resembling a rough sketch or a quick mock-up, low-fidelity wireframes can be quickly produced. these wireframes help a project team communicate ideas and collaborate more effectively since they are more abstract, using rectangles and labeling to represent content. dummy content, latin filler text (lorem ipsum), sample or symbolic content are used to represent data when real content is not available. for example, instead of using actual images, a placeholder rectangle can be used. low-fidelity wireframes can be used to facilitate team communication on a project and is used in the early stages of a project. high-fidelity high-fidelity wireframes are often used for documenting because they incorporate a level of detail that more closely matches the design of the actual webpage, thus taking longer to create. for simple or low-fidelity drawings, paper prototyping is a common technique. since these sketches are just representations, annotations—adjacent notes to explain behavior—are useful. for more complex projects, rendering wireframes using computer software is popular. some tools allow the incorporation of interactivity including flash animation, and front-end web technologies such as, html, css, and javascript. high fidelity wireframes include more real content, specific typography choices, and information on image dimensions. unlike low fidelity wireframes, high fidelity wireframes can include actual images. color choices are not included, but different values in color can be represented in grayscale. elements of wireframes the skeleton plan of a website can be broken down into three components: information design, navigation design, and interface design. page layout is where these components come together, while wireframing is what depicts the relationship between these components. information design information design is the presentation—placement and prioritization of information in a way that facilitates understanding. information design is an area of user experience design, meant to display information effectively for clear communication. for websites, information elements should be arranged in a way that reflects the goals and tasks of the user. navigation design the navigation system provides a set of screen elements that allow the user to move page to page through the website. the navigation design should communicate the relationship between the links it contains so that users understand the options they have for navigating the site. often, websites contain multiple navigation systems, such as a global navigation, local navigation, supplementary navigation, contextual navigation, and courtesy navigation. interface design user interface design includes selecting and arranging interface elements to enable users to interact with the functionality of the system. the goal is to facilitate usability and efficiency as much as possible. common elements found in interface design are action buttons, text fields, check boxes, radio buttons and drop-down menus. see also blueprint comprehensive layout graphic design information architecture interaction design user experience design user interface design web design

       " 'the sisters of the infant jesus, also known as the dames of saint maur, are a religious institute of the catholic church originating from paris, france and dedicated to teaching. history origins in 1659 barré, who was a respected scholar within his order, was sent to the monastery of the order in rouen. he became widely known as a preacher and his sermons attracted a large audience. in 1662 barré saw the need for the education of the poor in france. france in the late 17th century was suffering from the effects of the franco-spanish war (1635-1659) and a terrible plague. as a result of his efforts to promote a planned parish mission in the nearby village of sotteville-lès-rouen, barré came to see the suffering of the local population. to enable parents to attend the mission, barré asked two young women to come and help with the children. one was a local resident, françoise duval, 18 years old, the other was marguerite lestocq, then aged 20, who, like him, was from amiens and with whom he had family connections. he saw the need to make basic education more accessible to all. there were hardly any schools for girls and very few for boys. most primary school teachers were poorly educated and religious education was almost non-existent; there was profound ignorance of the catholic faith. in 1662, half the children in rouen died of famine. many were homeless and wandered the streets as beggars and, for some, prostitution became one of the few means of livelihood available. they began to give daily classes to young girls in a room which they were allowed to use, spending that year in this work. soon three other young women joined them, and two separate schools were opened. barré would visit the classes frequently, guiding the young women in how to teach and deal with both the children and their parents, drawing upon his own rigorous education under the jesuits and his experience as a professor. he taught them the value of \"instruction and education\" and from the beginning he trained the young teachers to respect the uniqueness of each child and to develop each one\\'s potential. the teachers were to speak in a humble, gentle and simple manner so that even the youngest could understand, and they were to teach only what they themselves had adequately grasped. as the enrollment increased, more schools were established, and four years later, the ladies in charge of these schools began to live in a community under a superior. this was the beginning of a religious congregation whose main work was the education of the poor. the year 1666 saw the founding of the congregation of the sisters of the infant jesus. after several years of teaching in the schools, the five young women were invited by barré to consider becoming part of a committed community. after some reflection, they felt that they were indeed called to this way of life and agreed. these women were not bound by religious vows or confined to a cloister. they were free to serve the local community and provide free education for poor children. they committed themselves to this in a legal document drawn up in 1669, becoming called the charitable teachers of the infant jesus (). as part of their living in trust in god, it was established that the material needs of the schools were to be handled by women outside the new community. expansion and division due to his declining health, in 1675 barré was sent to the minim monastery in paris. though limited in his activities, he promoted new foundations of his \"charitable schools of providence\", starting with two, saint jean en grèves and saint nicolas des champs, training teachers, both men and women for them. he urged his teachers not to wait until pupils arrived at the school; they were to seek out especially those who might be at risk. he also set up trade schools so that girls could earn a living. again, the education offered was to be entirely free and any profit derived from the pupils\\' work was to go to them. in 1677 barré began to send teachers to other locations in france, starting with his native picardy, reaching as far as new france in north america. these women were not part of a religious institute, and so were free to serve their local communities as needed, without the barriers that status would have imposed at that time. around that time, he acquired a house located on the rue saint maur in the 6th arrondissement of paris (now called the rue de l\\'abbé grégoire), which was to become the motherhouse of the institute. in 1677 a convent was established in rue saint maur, paris (ii) and the sisters were subsequently known as the \"dames of st. maur\". in 1678, barré founded a novitiate for the sisters on the seine. the daughters of providence were members of a catholic religious congregation for women founded in 1643, by a pious widow, marie polaillon (née de lumague) under a rule of life drawn up by vincent de paul. the daughters would profess annual vows of obedience, chastity, service and stability. in 1681 several houses of the congregation merged with the sisters of the congregation of the holy infant jesus, becoming the sisters of st. maur and of providence. a number of ‘little charitable schools\\' were established throughout france. in 1683 mother françoise duval, one of the foundresses, was sent to open a school in lisieux. at the time of barré\\'s death in 1686, there were over 100 schools being operated by the sisters of the holy infant jesus throughout france. throughout his life, barré had refused to allow the schools to accept benefices as a means of support, determined to place his trust in god alone, and was followed in this commitment by the teachers of the institute. upon his death, however, the lay trustees in paris and rouen, who were in charge of the finances of the schools and the teachers who staffed them, strongly disagreed over whether or not to continue this practice. this was eventually referred to the royal court, and, in 1691, king louis xiv divided the institute into three independent groups, with motherhouses in rouen, paris and lisieux. the sisters in the original communities became known as the sisters of providence of rouen and in 1921 became a congregation of diocesan right, under the authority of the local bishops where they served, with a missionary outreach in madagascar and central africa. the group based in lisieux also became a diocesan congregation. the sisters of st maur in paris became an institute of pontifical right with communities in five continents. current era southeast asia in 1849 a catholic missionary in the straits settlements, reverend father jean-marie beurel, a native of saint-brieuc in france, suggested to the colonial governor, william john butterworth, that it might be worthwhile to found a charitable organisation for girls next to the church in victoria street. in august 1852, beurel bought the house at the corner of victoria street and bras basah road. beurel then appealed to the superior general of the congregation in france for sisters to run a school. malaysia four sisters were sent to the east. after a long and perilous voyage, one had died at sea, three of them landed at penang in april 1852. that same year, the three sisters established a convent that contained an orphanage and school in penang. in september 1852, the congregation sent four sisters to penang, with mother mathilde raclot in charge, to guide and support the group of sisters who had arrived earlier. the school, convent light street (malay: smk convent lebuh light), is penang\\'s oldest girls\\' school and has occupied its current site along light street near historic george town for over 150 years. while on the peninsula, the sisters continued establishing schools with help from the local community such as kuala lumpur\\'s oldest girls\\' school convent bukit nanas and the only chinese convent girls school convent datuk keramat in penang. in 1952, st bernadette\\'s convent school was built in pusing road, batu gajah perak with land donated and funds raised from communities. during world war ii, the japanese invaded malaya and either took over or closed down many such mission schools, notably the iconic convent primary school in the hills of tanah rata. the tanah rata convent is one of the few in the region which still contains an operating school and a church. today, chij schools can be found in most states and many major cities and they continue to educate local girls of all races and religions. singapore in february 1854, three sisters led by rev. mother mathilde raclot arrived in singapore from penang and set up the convent in singapore at victoria street. soon they also started a convent orphanage and a home for abandoned babies as they found day-old babies were being left at their doorstep. to raise funds for their work, mother mathilde taught needlework to her fellow nuns and their students, and they sold their products to the wives of the local chinese merchants. the school became well-known and within ten years, the enrollment had increased to 300. secondary education began in 1905. under mother hombeline, the expansion programme continued. the convent occupied a full street block bordered by bras basah road, stamford road, victoria st and north bridge road. the iconic church was deconsecrated during the 1980s. part of the sisters\\' quarters has been demolished and converted into smrt corporation offices. most of the original buildings were redeveloped as part of the heritage board\\'s preservation scheme. the complex has since been redeveloped into a high-end retail complex called chijmes while the church is now a popular attraction for tourists and those interested in history. the eleven chij schools in singapore can trace their history to the victoria street convent. satellite schools were founded before and after world war ii. the \"original\" convent school is the present-day chij secondary and chij primary schools in toa payoh. chij saint nicholas girls\\' school (chij sngs) was co-located on the same site and functioned as the chinese section while chij secondary and primary were english-medium. after the abolition of vernacular schools, chij sngs was granted sap status. all three schools moved out of the victoria street complex during the 1980s into larger and more spacious facilities. east asia japan in 1872, mother mathilde led the first group of french nuns to japan and founded the saint maur international school in yokohama, where they teach and cared for the disadvantaged japanese women and children. mother mathilde raclot died, aged 97, in 1911 whilst still in yokohama, japan, and buried there. europe the shortage of english teachers forced the sisters to turn to the british isles in hopes of recruiting and training potential missionary teachers. in 1909, mother st beatrice foley, who had returned from singapore, established drishane convent in ireland. it had a \"knitting school\" for younger girls and was also used to train teachers for the asian mission. less than half a decade after opening, the convent was churning out teachers and sisters and sending them to asia and south america. south america the sisters first set foot in south america during the 1960s. some of the spanish-speaking sisters arrived in peru in 1967 and have since expanded to several other countries in the continent. motto the motto is simple dans ma vertu, forte dans mon devoir, which is often translated into \"simple in virtue, steadfast

       " 'james robert laxer (22 december 1941 - 23 february 2018), also known as jim laxer, was a canadian political economist, historian, public intellectual, and political activist who served as a professor at york university. best known as co-founder of the waffle, on whose behalf he ran for the leadership of the new democratic party in 1971, he was the author of more than two dozen books, mostly on canadian political economy and history. early life and family laxer was born in montreal, quebec, on 22 december 1941 and was the son of edna may (née quentin) and robert laxer, a psychologist, professor, author, and political activist. his father was jewish and his mother was from a protestant family. both were members of the communist party of canada and its public face, the labor-progressive party, with robert laxer being a national organizer for the party. the laxers left the party, along with many other members, following khrushchev\\'s secret speech revealing joseph stalin\\'s crimes, and the 1956 soviet invasion of hungary. james laxer wrote about his experiences growing up during this period in his memoir red diaper baby: a boyhood in the age of mccarthyism. his father came to serve as a significant influence on his political worldview. his paternal grandfather was a rabbi and his maternal grandfather was a minister and christian missionary to china, where laxer\\'s mother was born. his brother, gordon laxer, became a political economist, author, and founder of the parkland institute. he received a bachelor of arts degree from the university of toronto and master of arts (following approval of his thesis french-canadian newspapers and imperial defence, 1899-1914 in 1967) and doctor of philosophy degrees from queen\\'s university. he was an active student journalist both at the varsity at the university of toronto and later at the queen\\'s journal and was elected president of canadian university press in 1965. laxer married three times. he married diane taylor in 1965, from whom he was divorced in 1969. he married krista mäeots in 1969 with whom he had two children: michael and katherine (known as \"kate\"). they were separated at the time of her death in 1978. laxer married sandra price in 1979 with whom he had two more children: emily and jonathan. political career in 1969, laxer, along with his father robert laxer, mel watkins, and others, founded the waffle, a left-wing group influenced by the new left, the anti-vietnam war movement, and canadian economic nationalism, that tried to influence the direction of the new democratic party (ndp). laxer was a principal author of their manifesto for an independent socialist canada in 1969 alongside ed broadbent and gerald caplan. the manifesto was debated at the 1969 federal ndp convention and was rejected by the delegates in favour of a more moderate declaration. in 1971, laxer ran for the leadership of the federal ndp and shocked the convention by winning one-third of the vote on the fourth and final ballot against party stalwart david lewis. the waffle was ultimately forced out of the ndp and briefly became a political party under the name movement for an independent socialist canada. laxer and other wafflers unsuccessfully ran for parliament in 1974. this electoral failure led to the waffle\\'s demise, and laxer concentrated on his work at york university, where he was a professor of political science for 47 years, and in broadcasting. in 1981, he was hired as director of research for the federal ndp, but left in controversy in 1983 when he published a report critiquing the party\\'s economic policy as being \"out of date\". academic, writer, and broadcaster laxer hosted the real story, a nightly half-hour current affairs program on tvontario in the early 1980s. he also variously wrote a column and op-ed pieces for the toronto star from the 1980s until shortly before his death, as well as op-ed pieces for the globe and mail. he also played \"talleyrand\", a mock political insider, on cbc radio\\'s morningside in the 1980s. laxer co-wrote and presented the five-part national film board documentary series reckoning: the political economy of canada in 1986, which examined canada\\'s economic and political relationships with the united states and canada\\'s place in the changing global economy. laxer and his co-writer won a gemini award in 1988 for best writing in an information/documentary program or series for episode one of reckoning titled \"in bed with an elephant\". the canadian broadcasting corporation refused to air the series due to its critical view of free trade with the united states, which was being negotiated at the time, and it aired instead on tvontario and other educational channels in canada as well as a number of pbs stations in the united states. a democratic socialist, laxer believed that canadian economic nationalism was a progressive force against the united states and american imperialism. he wrote extensively about the influence of american multinational corporations in the canadian economy, particularly in the oil and gas industry, and his agitation helped lead to the creation of petro-canada. the creation of the foreign investment review agency, and the canadian development corporation in the 1970s is also attributed in part to the work of laxer, watkins, and the waffle. in the 1980s he strongly opposed the adoption of the canada-us free trade agreement, though he still believed that free trade agreements were capable of being used to the advantage of the political left through the entrenchment of social charters. laxer died suddenly and unexpectedly in paris of heart-related problems on 23 february 2018 while in europe researching a book on

       " '20 minute loop is a san francisco-based band notable for its self-proclaimed \"freak-pop\" sound which exhibited hook-heavy tunes and complex vocal harmonies. the band split up in 2009, but has since reformed. history in its most rudimentary form, 20 minute loop was founded innominately by giles during college, circa 1995, as a home-recording project. he recorded a handful of demos to 8-track tape, but never officially released them. he did, however, have the opportunity to play them live to small audiences acoustically several times, usually with the vocal accompaniment of kelly atkins, who would later be the only consistent member in 20 minute loop besides giles. giles originally toyed with other band names, such as with god on the dog team trail, pierre bon bon, kill whitey!, and psa flight 182, before finally settling on 20 minute loop. the band\\'s name alluded to the duration of cockpit conversation recorded by an airplane\\'s cockpit voice recorder for recovery in the event of a crash or other accident. the actual band was established by greg giles in 1996, and their debut ep, with god on the dog team trail, was released on new year\\'s day in 1997. (apart from kelly atkins, the band lineup giles recruited for the ep featured no members of the final lineup.) with god on the dog team trail featured a lo-fi rendition of \"jubilation\"—which was rerecorded for decline of day—as well as three other songs that were never released in any other form. with god on the dog team trail was released on a small indie label, trystero records, which was run by a friend of giles and has since gone defunct. the band soon parted with trystero, and struggled along for a while with no means of releasing their music. they had recorded their first, self-titled album, and were already in the process of recording decline of day, when jim greer of the small, berkeley-based indie label fortune records (not to be confused with the defunct detroit, michigan-based label of the same name) approached and offered to sign them. this begun a long-lasting relationship with fortune records—greer would go on to release their first 3 albums and a split 7-inch with the monolith. their debut album, 20 minute loop, was released to mostly positive critical reception, and thanks to positive publicity from local venues and indie distributor aquarius records, among others, they gained some recognition from the bay area indie scene. the band also played a great many shows in order to receive more publicity. with a label deal and an album to their name, the band quickly released their second album, decline of day. this album received much more publicity, with positive reviews from pitchfork, allmusic, and cd universe, et alia; yet the group still remained fairly unknown. the artwork for the album was provided by the velvet teen\\'s lead singer judah nagler. the band\\'s breakthrough would arrive along with their next album, yawn + house = explosion, reviews for which appeared in nearly a dozen printed publications, as well as countless indie blogs. the artwork for yawn + house = explosion was of particular interest to many; the outside consisted of two different shots of a prepubescent girl grasping chickens, and the inside pamphlet consisted of the lyrics, many of which were determined using a dictionary game invented by the band, spelled out in such a way that it could be seen how certain words were strung together with the lyrics. this was the only album of 20 minute loop\\'s to sell out; it sold a couple thousand copies. the band parted from fortune records for unclear reasons to record their fourth album, famous people marry famous people. the album, released in 2008, was arguably the band\\'s most polished and intricate—it was recorded at john vanderslice\\'s renowned tiny telephone studio in san francisco, and featured over a half-dozen extra performers. the album featured highly conceptual songs, with sophisticated underlying themes explained on each song\\'s individual bandcamp page. the album received slightly less publicity due to the loss of a label, but the band still did very well, receiving positive publicity from many well-known sites, such as popmatters and kqed, amongst others. the band played a few more shows before announcing a breakup on their myspace, due to an inability to continue \"outmaneuvering real-life contingencies\". they announced that their \"final show ever\" would take place on november 15, but, untrue to their word, they reunited for noise pop 2012, opening for imperial teen. in 2014, greg giles and kelly atkins reformed 20 minute loop with kevin seal of griddle to unearth songs in a new stripped down format, including piano, guitar, viola and trumpet and focusing more on vocal harmonies and lyrical content. jim greer of fortune records was inspired to record this version of 20 minute loop. they released the album songs praising the mutant race in 2017, and have had numerous appearances since then, their most recent being in february 2023 at great american music hall. members kelly atkins - vocals, keyboards, synthesizer, rhodes, wurlitzer, flute, samples greg giles - guitar, vocals, synthesizer nils erickson - bass, guitar, rhodes, clavinet, pedal steel guitar, backing vocals adam cunha - bass, backing vocals mike romano - drums, percussion, piano, backing vocals kevin seal - piano, rhodes, vocals former members joe ostrowski - guitar james kingsbury - bass alex kamages - drums dan jones - bass ethan turner - drums tai kenning - drums, percussion discography studio albums with god on the dog team trail cd (trystero, 1997) jubilation onion smut car crash the song you hear before you die 20 minute loop cd (fortune records, 1999) she hated dogs everybody out face like a horse aeroflot up on the hill disconnect you know so much bunnyman and chickengirl hookworm all my friends/drowning decline of day cd (fortune records, 2001) jubilation moses all manner daughter\\'s down pilot light force of habit mechanical angels elephant mompha termina vaccine hell in a handbasket aquarium song/kiddie porn sting yawn + house = explosion cd (fortune records, 2005) parking lot cora may properties of dirt book of j carlos the jackal it\\'s time to honor ghouls ambassadors 5 am to 9 am our william tell i\\'ll never forget you miriam hopkins famous people marry famous people cd (self-released, 2009) vanilla march dr. vitus werdegast english as a second language the bone is the orbital planet of the nerve automatic pilot empire we wait for the crown mercury vapor latin names and straight pins esma the kirkbridge plan winsor mccay songs praising the mutant race (self-released, 2017) mercury vapor english as a second language empire giftgas elephant hell in a handbasket parking lot drowning aquarium carlos the jackal winsor mccay never my love compilation appearances she hated dogs appears on fortune cookies (fortune records, 2000) pilot light appears on azadi!

       " 'thomcord is a seedless table grape variety and a hybrid of the popular thompson seedless or sultanina grape (a vitis vinifera variety) and concord grape (a vitis labrusca variety). thomcord was developed in 1983 by californian grape breeders working for the agricultural research service (ars), an agency of the united states department of agriculture (usda), as part of a test to better understand a new seedless grape breeding procedure. its aromatic, \"labrusca\" flavor is similar to that of concord, but mellowed by the mild, sweet taste from thompson seedless. thomcord grows well in hot, dry climates, ripens between late july and mid-august, and tolerates powdery mildew. it is a productive variety, yielding an average of of grapes per vine, but has produced as much as per vine in grower trials. the berries weigh between and have a medium-thick, blue-black skin that adheres to the fruit, unlike concord, which has a thick skin that can slip off the pulp easily. the aborted seeds in the fruit body are relatively small, but larger than those in thompson seedless. the plant is not restricted for propagation and distribution. virus-free propagation material is available from the foundation plant services (fps) at the university of california, davis, and its genetic material is archived at the national plant germplasm system. after 17 years of testing, it was declared ready for use in 2003. it is currently available in supermarkets. description thomcord grape is a hybrid of thompson seedless grape (vitis vinifera, or sultanina), which is popular in american (?) supermarkets during the summer, and seeded concord grape (vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. it is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than concord. thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. unlike concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like thompson seedless. it has an aromatic flavor, similar to the concord in taste (\"labrusca\"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from thompson seedless. thomcord is suitable for hot, dry growing conditions, more so than concord and other concord seedless types. its adaptability to hot dry climates was derived from thompson seedless. it grows well in california\\'s vineyards, particularly the san joaquin valley, just like thompson seedless. the plant is tolerant of (but not resistant to) powdery mildew, and is less susceptible to the fungus than ruby seedless, but more susceptible than mars, venus, niabell, and cayuga white varieties. the fungus can affect its leaves, stems, rachis (stem of the grape cluster), and berries. the grape ripens in the summer (mid-season), between late july and mid-august. production details thomcord is a productive variety, with a yield comparable to thompson seedless. when two cordons (arms) of the vines are trained horizontally on wires (\"bilateral-trained\") and are pruned to remove most of the previous year\\'s growth (\"spur-pruned\") during the winter, it can produce up to per vine, or an average of . in 2002, cane-pruned vines of thomcord were significantly more productive than sovereign coronation and were comparable to the venus variety, averaging per vine. unlike thompson seedless, which has its cluster size thinned as a normal production practice, thomcord\\'s is not thinned because of its smaller cluster size. the grape clusters range in weight between and average , have medium to slightly loose tightness (or are \"well-filled\", meaning the individual pedicels are not easily visible), and have a conical shape with a small wing. compared with thompson seedless, the berry weight and diameter of thomcord are larger, but cluster tightness is similar. the berry length ranged between and the diameter ranged from in tests between 2001 and 2002. the berries weigh between , averaging in 2002, which is on par with venus, but heavier than sovereign coronation, and even more so than thompson seedless. the fruit\\'s size has not been shown to increase appreciably by girdling the vines or by applying gibberellic acid when the berries set. the aborted seeds of thomcord are small, but in some years they can become sclerified (a thickening and lignification of the walls of plant cells and the subsequent dying off of the protoplasts), making them more noticeable inside the medium-soft flesh. there are usually two aborted seeds per berry, which averaged between 14 and 22.3 mg in 2001 and 2002. this varied in comparison to venus depending on the year and location, was comparable to the sovereign coronation, and was significantly smaller than the sovereign rose and saturn varieties. however, as with the other cultivars, it was consistently larger than thompson seedless, which had the smallest aborted seeds. vegetative description the mature leaves on the vine have three lobes with open upper lateral sinuses (spaces between the lobes) of medium depth. the main vein is slightly longer than the petiole (stalk attaching the leaf blade to the stem), and the petiole sinus opens widely. between the veins on the underside of both the mature and young leaf there are dense hairs that lie flat against the surface. the teeth on the edge of the leaf blade are convex on both sides, medium in size, and short relative to their width. young leaf blades are dark copper red on the upper surface. the shoots have at least three consecutive tendrils. young shoots are fully open and have very dense hairs of medium anthocyanin coloration that lie flat against the tip. the internode of the young shoot is green with red stripes on the front (dorsal) side and solid green on the back (ventral) side. history in 1983, research horticulturist david w. ramming and technician ronald l. tarailo—californian grape breeders working for the ars, the chief scientific research agency of the usda—crossed thompson seedless and concord in order to answer a technical question about a newly developed procedure for breeding novel, superior seedless grapes. the researchers wanted to demonstrate that plants created from embryo culture were derived from fertilized eggs (zygotic) instead of the maternal tissue (somatic). from 1231 emasculations (removal of male flower parts to control pollination) of thompson seedless, the researchers produced 130 ovules using embryo rescue procedures. from these, 40 embryos developed and three seedlings were planted. the original seedling of thomcord was planted in 1984 in plots in cooperation with california state university, fresno. it was later selected in 1986 by ramming and tarailo and tested in the san joaquin valley under the name a29-67, and was introduced as \"thomcord.\" the new hybrid was tested and scrutinized for 17 years before it was declared ready for growers and gardeners and was released on 11 september 2003. around 2008, trials outside of california were just beginning. thomcord quickly became a hit at farmers\\' markets while it was being tested, and it has appeared in the fresh-fruit section at supermarkets. this continued the long-standing success of the ars\\' grape-breeding research in california, which has developed some of the most popular seedless grapes on the market as well as red, white, and black grapes varieties for hobbyists and professional growers since 1923. although it has been called a \"sentimental favorite\" at farmers\\' markets, it is not expected to become a major commercial variety because its flavor is not as neutral as more popular grapes, such as thompson seedless, crimson seedless, or flame seedless. however, ramming predicted that it would become a specialty item, much like the muscat varieties, due to its distinctive, concord-like flavor. because of its strong reception at farmers\\' markets, it could compete with concord and niabell varieties in eastern markets, according to ramming. availability the foundation plant services (fps) at the university of california, davis indexed thomcord and found it to be free of known viruses. the fps offers certified virus-free propagation material. the fps also deposited genetic material in the national plant germplasm system, which offers material for research, including development and commercialization of new cultivars. the ars does not offer thomcord plants for distribution. thomcord is a public variety and is not restricted in its propagation and distribution. see also list of

       " 'cyril duval (born december 31, 1977), who works under the name item idem, is a french conceptual artist, designer, and filmmaker. he lives and works in taipei, taiwan. biography duval was born in paris, france, in 1977. his mother worked for the luxury goods manufacturer hermès, while his father was an interior decorator. duval studied for six years at the école nationale supérieure d\\'arts de paris-cergy, before moving to tokyo in 2004. career duval\\'s work encompasses conceptual art, film, sculpture, product design, and visual communication. his alter ego item idem (latin for \"the same\"), operates as a brand for the artist, whose work often builds on top of existing fashion and retail brands. the new york times reviewed one of duval\\'s performances as \"celine dion at the oscars channeling rené magritte,\" while the writer john stones has described the artist\\'s persona as \"austin powers pretending to be philippe starck, art directed by marcel duchamp and scripted by oscar wilde.\" retail design and installations in 2004, duval was discovered by sarah andelman, the creative director of colette. the paris-based boutique teamed duval up with the japanese fashion label comme des garçons in tokyo. his work began to incorporate interior design and conceptual installations. in 2004, duval collaborated with other artists on a relational aesthetics-inspired, multidisciplinary space called caniche courage, and later transformed his three-story shibuya residence into a living exhibition. duval initiated a series of staged retail and working environments, beginning with the wrong store (2006) in paris, a collaboration with tobi wong conceived as an ersatz gift-shop counterpart to maurizio cattelan\\'s wrong gallery. back in tokyo, he transformed the window display of a fashion boutique into a temporary work space titled the wrong office, which he followed up with the wrong motel. duval collaborated with bernhard willhelm on the german fashion designer\\'s flagship store at the parco department store in shibuya, tokyo. the shop\\'s re-use of cardboard, plastic, and rope materials was inspired by the resourcefulness of japan\\'s homeless communities. the store won the best shop concept for frame magazine\\'s 2007 great indoors award. in 2009, duval participated in the cycles and seasons fashion and art event in moscow. in 2011, duval was the first artist-in-residence at bless home, an apartment-cum-shop in berlin, which became his temporary studio while serving as the art director for bruce labruce\\'s production of pierrot lunaire. in 2015, he built an installation as an interior for airbnb\\'s art house for art basel hong kong. duval has worked with a number of art publications, including as the fashion director for tokion (2005), fashion features director for modern weekly china (2013), special projects coordinator for flash art (2006), and as a collaborator with 032c, t: the new york times style magazine, and leap magazine. he has also worked on large-scale commercial projects for celine and ford. exhibitions and collaborations in 2007, duval reconfigured celine\\'s tokyo store to host his exhibition displaysthetics during designtide tokyo. in 2008, he participated in fredric snitzer gallery\\'s show in miami, death by basel, with an oversized chanel logo in the style of mcdonald\\'s golden arches, as a comparison of the brands and their markets. for aa bronson\\'s school for young shaman\\'s exhibition in new york, duval fashioned a cape out of louis vuitton bags and melted car tires, which was an homage to joseph beuys. for the exhibition dysfashional at the garage museum in moscow in 2010, duval created a work titled mount blushmore, a crystal engraving which combined images of fashion icons anna wintour, donatella versace, john galliano and karl lagerfeld. in 2014, duval mounted his first solo exhibition at johannes vogt, new york, titled voir dire. in 2016, duval participated in the work in progress artist residency in times square, new york. that same year, he held an exhibition titled method of loci at the breeder gallery in athens, greece, and collaborated with flash art special projects in a special presentation at paramount ranch. duval has exhibited at the centre pompidou, the garage museum, moma ps1, and palais de tokyo. his work has been featured in 032c, casa brutus, frame, the new york times, frankfurter allgemeine zeitung, harper\\'s bazaar korea, and wwd. shanzhai biennial duval is the co-founder of the artists collective shanzhai biennial with stylist avena gallagher and artist babak radboy. the collective describes itself as a \"multinational brand posing as an art-project posing as an [sic] multinational brand posing as a biennial\", \"a pure brand unencumbered by products\", in other words a \"meta-brand\". the name is meant to evoke a bi-annual art exhibition, but instead of taking a city as its namesake, it refers to the shanzhai counterfeit consumer goods industry in china, and the intentionally incorrect appropriation of luxury brand names. inspired by knockoff goods in manhattan\\'s chinatown, the collective was initiated as a critique of the art and fashion industries, as well as a celebration of the ingenuity and humour of shanzhai culture. the collective undertakes projects by invitation from cultural institutions or brands, and highlights the aspect of shanzhai that m+ curator aric chen has called the \"pop art of china\". as a precursor to the collective\\'s projects, duval curated a selection of shanzhai objects in collaboration with dis magazine. the objects were photographed by marco roso for an exhibition titled shanzhai anxiety at colette in 2011. shanzhai biennial no. 1 was held during beijing design week 2012. the artists created a fake fashion campaign photo-shoot based on the paintings of chinese artist yue minjun, and installed a false store-front in beijing\\'s chaochangdi village, complete with red carpet, rope lines, and a step and repeat press wall. the ad campaign also ran as an eight-page editorial in the chinese lifestyle magazine modern weekly. when the new york times mistook the project for \"a high-concept fashion line\" that hadn\\'t yet produced a collection, the artists decided not to issue a correction. shanzhai biennial no. 2 consisted of a video depicting the artist wu ting ting dressed as a shampoo bottle and lip-syncing to a chinese rendition of sinéad o\\'connor\\'s nothing compares 2 u, and was displayed on an led curtain for moma ps1\\'s probio exhibition in 2013. the artists followed this up with shanzhai biennial no. 3 at frieze london 2014, conceived as a branding exercise for the art fair. working with a local luxury real-estate agency, the artists transformed a booth space into a model real-estate office ostensibly selling a £32 million london mansion, complete with a professional ad campaign, and trafficking in the frieze brand with a fake luxury bag, and limited edition souvenirs. shanzhai biennial has collaborated with the designer telfar clemens, the musician fatima al qadiri, as well as tanktv and dis magazine, and has exhibited work at west bund art & design, centre pompidou, and the new museum. films in 2013, duval created the short film joss with chinese artist cheng ran, depicting paper funeral items resembling fashion accessories and commercial brands being destroyed by flames and fire crackers. the film has been screened at palais de tokyo (paris), k11 art foundation pop-up space (hong kong), and museum of contemporary art taipei. duval\\'s short film nuii premièred at the bethlehem baptist church in los angeles in 2017. the film features corporate and political symbols being burnt in effigy. his experimental short film cold single was filmed in taitung, taiwan, with taiwanese director mel hsieh, inspired by his life in the country. the film was presented for the first time at

       " 'water supply and sanitation in vietnam is characterized by challenges and achievements. among the achievements is a substantial increase in access to water supply and sanitation between 1990 and 2010, nearly universal metering, and increased investment in wastewater treatment since 2007. among the challenges are continued widespread water pollution, poor service quality, low access to improved sanitation in rural areas, poor sustainability of rural water systems, insufficient cost recovery for urban sanitation, and the declining availability of foreign grant and soft loan funding as the vietnamese economy grows and donors shift to loan financing. this has caused many vietnamese to not fully trust water sources that may not be safe or clean, or even avoiding tap water and only using water that has been filtered and boiled. in vietnam, it is not recommended to drink tap water directly. the vietnamese government encourages to at least boil water before consumption, with many familiar with water filters but rural places often not being able to own one or lack access to them due to poverty or distance from more urban areas. the government also promotes increased cost recovery through tariff revenues and has created autonomous water utilities at the provincial level, but the policy has had mixed success as tariff levels remain low and some utilities have engaged in activities outside their mandate. access in 2015, 98% of the total population in vietnam had access to \"improved\" water, or 99% and 97%, for the urban and rural population, respectively. that means that around 2 million people lacked access to \"improved\" water. regarding sanitation, 78% of the population in vietnam had access to \"improved\" sanitation, or 94% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population. still, approximately 21 million people in vietnam, in 2015, lacked accessed to \"improved\" sanitation. according to the un\\'s joint monitoring programme for water supply and sanitation, access to an improved water source increased from 58% in 1990 to 96% in 2010. however, most vietnamese receive water from a tap in the yard or a public tap in the village from where they have to carry water to their home. in 2010, only 23% of vietnamese had a tap in their home. there are substantial differences in access between urban and \"rural\" areas. 70% of the vietnamese population lives in rural areas, but many so-called rural areas are actually small towns, e.g. in the densely settled red river delta. in urban areas, 59% had a tap in their home, while in rural areas this share was only 8%. in 2009 over 200 out of approximately 650 district towns did not have any piped water system. access to improved sanitation increased from 37% in 1990 to 75% in 2011. there is a significant gap between urban areas, where access stands at 93%, and rural areas with an access of only 67%. in 2009, 75% of households in provincial towns were not connected to a sewer. septic tanks are common, but with the exception of hai phong, no town offers a reasonable desludging service. water resources vietnam has abundant surface and ground water resources. nevertheless, local shortages can occur during the dry season. for example, the basins of the dong nai river in south vietnam, the southeast river cluster, ma river in north central vietnam, kone river and huong river are expected to be at risk of exceeding projected water needs in 2020. the 7 million people in ho chi minh city receive 93% of their drinking water from two treatment plants on the dong nai river and the much smaller sai gon river, with the remaining 7% coming from overexploited groundwater that is polluted by seawater intrusion and contamination. dong nai river, which is regulated further upstream by two dams, has ample water resources to supply the growing city with more water. however, in dry years drinking water supply competes with agricultural uses that may together exceed water availability. hanoi with its more than 6 million inhabitants receives 80% of its water from groundwater. groundwater is polluted by ammonium with a concentration that is 5 to 10 times (7-20 mg/l) higher than the allowed standard. surface water comes from the gia lam plant completed in 1994 and the thang long north-van tri plant completed in 2004, both financed by japanese development assistance. it is planned that surface water from the da river, the red river and the duong river will satisfy the growing water demand in the future and gradually replace the existing ground water. during the dry season in 2013 several districts of hanoi went completely without water. a transmission pipeline from the existing plant on the da river suffered numerous breaks, exacerbating water scarcity. the vietnamese company vinaconex built the pipeline with fibreglass-reinforced pipes that it manufactured itself using. with anti-chinese sentiment riding high in vietnam, the faults have been blamed on the perceived low-cost chinese technology behind the manufacturing process. when a chinese firm won a contract to build a second pipeline in 2016, the government cancelled the contract. service quality drinking water quality in early 2009 tests by the vietnam institute of biotechnology showed widespread contamination of municipal tap water, including high levels of e-coli. most residents boil drinking water, because they do not trust the quality of the tap water, or use bottled water. some tap water samples were also contaminated with ammonia at levels that were 6-18 times higher than the allowed level. ammonia in drinking water is not a direct health risk, but it can compromise disinfection efficiency, cause the failure of some filters, and it causes taste and odor problems. arsenic levels were two to three times higher than acceptable according to the world health organization guidelines. bacteria were also found in bottled water samples, according to analyses by the ho chi minh city health department in 2009, leading to 38 water bottling firms being ordered closed. pollution and wastewater treatment water pollution is a serious issue in vietnam as a result of rapid industrialization and urbanization without adequate environmental management. as of 2008 only 10 percent of municipal wastewater was treated, and only 45% of industrial zones were expected to have wastewater treatment of some kind in 2010. the pollution of rivers and lakes in hanoi is \"alarming\" according to municipal authorities, as up to 98 per cent of 200 rivers and lakes fail to meet the required water quality. sewer systems consist of combined sewers, channeling both rainwater and municipal sewage. small enterprises engaged in food processing and textile dyeing in so-called \"craft villages\", of which there are 700 in the red river delta alone, discharge untreated wastewater. an analysis by the university of technologies and the ministry of science and technology showed that 100% of wastewater samples taken from craft villages exceed allowed levels of pollution. vietnam also has more than 200 registered industrial zones without sustainable wastewater treatment. industrial zones discharge 1 million cubic meters of untreated sewage per day, about 70 percent of all industrial wastewater. 8 industrial zones will be equipped with wastewater treatment plants with the help of a us$50 million loan from the world bank approved in 2012. it is also planned to construct 30 wastewater treatment plants in the mekong delta until 2020, including 13 plants for domestic wastewater treatment and 17 for industrial wastewater treatment in can tho, a giang, kien giang and ca mau provinces. in 2012 hanoi expected to start the operation of the upgraded yen so waste water treatment plant with a design capacity of 200,000 cubic meters per day; eight more wastewater treatment plants are planned in hanoi alone. responsibility for water supply and sanitation responsibility for policy setting within the national government responsibility for water supply and sanitation is shared between three ministries. urban water supply and sewerage is under the ministry of construction. rural water supply is under the ministry of agriculture and rural development, while rural sanitation and hygiene are under the ministry of health. the structure of ministries is mirrored at the provincial level, where each ministry has branches. the 58 provinces have considerable autonomy in implementing policies. for example, some focus on public sector service provision, while others − especially in the south - promote the private sector. national policies and targets the government policy is to achieve full cost recovery for water supply and partial cost recovery for urban sanitation. decree 117/2007 requires water supply tariffs to be set to full cost recovery and decree 88/2007 requires sanitation to be charged through a surcharge of the water tariff at a minimum of 10% to achieve recovery of the operation and maintenance costs. in 2009 the government introduced the policy of \"socialization\" or \"equitization\" of water supply companies through prime minister instruction 854/2009. the policy is a byword for creating financially autonomous utilities that would ultimately be able to borrow from commercial banks. the government aims at providing 90% of the urban population with access to safe drinking water and at collecting and treating 100% of the urban wastewater by 2020. the latter goal had been set for 2010 as part of the vietnam development goals, but only 10% of urban wastewater was treated as of 2008 according to the ministry of construction. furthermore, the government aims at reducing non-revenue water to 15% by 2020, to provide 120--150 liters of water per capita per day, and to make water companies financially self-sustaining by 2025. the latter target had also been set for 2010, but was missed. there is a national strategy for rural clean water supply and sanitation that was approved in 2000, which emphasizes a demand-responsive approach, meaning that users should take important decisions such as the most appropriate technology and the model of service provision. policy implementation and monitoring the \"equitization\" was completed in 2010, but - unlike the central government intended - the provincial governments used water utilities to engage in lucrative real estate deals. provincial and local governments are reluctant to raise tariffs in line with government policies, and the sanitation surcharge is often insufficient to recover even operating costs, leaving local governments with the burden to subsidize the operating costs of wastewater companies. tariffs were thus barely increased and the level of cost recovery remains low, especially for wastewater. the asian development bank concluded in 2010: there is no meaningful monitoring system for the sector goals. the sector goals concerning access to drinking water and sanitation are not defined in terms of the definition of the un\\'s joint monitoring programme for water supply and sanitation, which is considered too loose, but in terms of a more narrow definition of access. there is a large number of performance criteria, but there are no baseline data and no methodology for monitoring. there may even be a disincentive for provinces to improve their monitoring systems, since it is in their interest to show that their access figures are low and that they are in need of more central funds. in rural areas decision-making often remains top-down, with little or no meaningful participation by users. for example, in some provinces in central vietnam piped water supply with meters is provided at high costs, while users continue to use water that comes in hose pipes from nearby sources, because it is cheaper and is considered of better quality. the asian development bank concludes: responsibility for service provision water supply and sanitation in vietnam is the responsibility of numerous categories of service providers, with substantial differences in the categories of service providers between urban and rural areas. urban areas water supply in cities and some larger towns is provided by state-owned provincial water service companies (wscs). provincial wscs have evolved from a centralized national water supply organization during the 1990s. their autonomy is still limited. key decisions such as budgets, staff salary and benefits, and senior management appointments require approval by the provincial government. assets are owned by the province, not the wsc. there is no contractual relationship between the province and the wsc. some wscs are public service enterprises (pses), while others have converted to private-law enterprises on the basis of the enterprise law. some wscs only operate the water systems, while others also design or even build them. some even manufacture equipment. some wsc are active outside their geographical jurisdiction. sewerage and wastewater treatment in cities is the responsibility of provincial urban environmental companies. in some provinces they provide only sewerage and wastewater treatment, while in others they have many other responsibilities such as solid waste collection, and again in other provinces wscs are also in charge of sewerage. private sector participation in urban water supply is limited to build-operate-transfer (bot) contracts for drinking water treatment plants. in ho chi minh city (hcmc), a malaysian firm has been operating the binh an plant since 1994. the thu duc 2 treatment plant in hcmc and a raw water pumping station supplying water to ha noi, including a transmission main from hoa binh, are owned and operated by joint stock companies. rural areas in small towns and rural areas there are six service models: operated by the provincial branch of the national center for rural water supply and sanitation cerwass (41% of schemes) direct management by town-level people\\'s committee (24% of schemes); community management (23% of schemes, mostly of small size); agricultural cooperatives (4%); other state-owned enterprises, mainly consisting of district water supply companies and/or environmental service companies (1%); private water companies (3%). a 2007 survey by cerwass in 39 provinces inventoried 4,433 piped water schemes, finding that those operated by cerwass were best operated and maintained (62% classified as \"good\"), compared to those operated by people committees (38%) and communities (25%). most early private water systems were built and financed by local residents and water tariffs are high. since 2007 private water companies began operating larger water systems, such as in lim town, with a total population of approximately 12,500, and minh duc town, with a total population of 11,700, under competitively awarded 10-year lease contracts with the provincial water company. these contracts introduced a new service provision model to small towns in vietnam. the national center for rural water supply and sanitation (cerwass) and its provincial branch offices provides grant financing, requiring a user contribution, and organizes the construction of infrastructure. it also still operates water systems, although it is supposed to withdraw from this function. a world bank study of rural water supply service delivery models in 2010 showed that there have been limited efforts to create the institutional framework necessary for sustainable service provision, that up to 90% of wells drilled are not operational and that \"a large part of systems break down completely or need major repair within 3-4 years\", partly due to poor quality construction. a 2007 survey showed a slightly better picture. it found that out of 4,433 piped water schemes 41% were well operated and maintained, 35% had \"medium\" operation and maintenance, and 24% had poor or no operation and maintenance. efficiency according to a national urban water benchmarking system set up by the viet nam water supply and sewerage association (vwsa) with the support for the asian development bank, non-revenue water is reported by provincial water companies as having been reduced from 39% in 2000 to around 30% in 2009 on average. however, vwsa itself questions the reliability of these figures. in some cities, non-revenue water is as high as 75%. the government says it wants to reduce non-revenue water to 25% by 2015 and 15% by 2025. financial aspects investment and financing between 1992 and 2002 about us$1 billion ($100 million per year) was invested in urban water supply and sanitation, out of which us$ 838m was financed by external donors. in rural areas, between 1999 and 2002 a total of vnd 3.160 billion ($225 million, corresponding to $56 million per year) was invested, out of which vnd 1,460 billion (46%) was financed by users themselves, vnd 1300 billion (41%) by the government and \"other sources\", and only vnd 400 million (13 percent) by donors. the total investment of usd 156m per year corresponds to less than 2 usd per capita and year. tariff levels and adjustment urban water tariffs are set by the executive branch of each province, the provincial people\\'s committees, after the provincial water supply company (wsc) submits their tariff proposal. often the people\\'s committees obtain the consent of the legislative branch, the people\\'s council. tariffs are reviewed annually. a 1999 circular 03/1999 said that local government must gradually increase water tariffs to fully recover costs. implementation has been slow at first, but it sped up when in 2004 the ministry of finance and the ministry of construction issued a joint circular stipulating the common tariff framework for the whole country, including rural areas. in 2003 residential urban water tariffs were typically in the range vnd 1600 to 2700/m3, with an average of vnd 2,181/m3 (us$0.15/m3). according to another source, the average water tariff for all user categories - residential, commercial and others - was $0.26/m3 in 2009. where water consumption is metered, increasing-block tariffs are applied. the second block of the tariff often starts at a low level of consumption. for example, in hcmc it starts at 4 cubic meters per month. however, connection fees are high, especially in small towns, and - according to the world bank - were \"a major obstacle to achieving greater coverage of water supply services\" in 2005. sewer tariffs did not exist until the early 2000s and have only been introduced gradually. in hcmc the sewer tariff was only 10 percent of the water tariff, far below the actual cost of sewerage and wastewater treatment. cooperatives and community-based water supply systems in small towns set their own water tariffs, which are then approved by the provincial people\\'s committee. in rural areas, water is typically not being charged for. cost recovery and affordability in 2004, all wsc except two recovered their operating costs from tariff revenues. the average operating cost coverage ratio was 168% in 2009. there is no information on cost recovery in small towns and rural areas. water bills for those connected are below 2 percent of household expenditures. in slums, residents often cannot connect to the public water system since they are not formally registered. they are forced to buy water from households with connections at a price that is 2−8 times higher than the water tariff. external cooperation the main external donors in water supply and sanitation in vietnam are the asian development bank and japan, followed by the world bank and germany. in rural areas four smaller donor − australia, denmark, the uk and the netherlands − have joined forces to provide budget support for a national program. germany germany promotes sustainable sanitation through a wastewater management program that involves technical cooperation and financial cooperation. the program ran from 2005 to 2014. it has influenced the national regulatory framework for sanitation through waste water management decree 88/2007 enacted by the prime minister and a corresponding circular enacted in 2009 by the ministry of construction. furthermore, it supports provincial people\\'s committees and wastewater companies in nine provinces through the elaboration of corporate development plans and the financing of sewers and wastewater treatment plants. these are lang son, son la, hoa binh, bac ninh and hai duong in the north, vinh in the centre, as well as tra vinh, soc trang and can tho in the mekong delta. in 2010 the province of soc trang has been the first to enact a sewer tariff that is designed to recover the costs of operation and maintenance. in 2012 bac ninh introduced a sewer tariff that is designed to recover half the operation and maintenance costs, with the aim of fully recovering them in 2014. the program also supports information campaigns to increase environmental and health awareness. japan jica supports \"water environment improvement\" in the provinces thừa thiên-huế and đồng nai. in bình dương, near ho chi minh city, jica provides a low-interest loan of almost 20 billion yen (us$170 million) for a sewer system and measures to conserve the city\\'s source of drinking water. world bank the world bank provides support through 12 projects approved between 1997 and 2013 with a total lending of more than us$1 billion. one of them is the red river delta rural water supply and sanitation projects that promoted participatory approaches through the creation of joint-stock companies. the world bank-administered global partnership for output-based aid (gpoba) supports public-private partnerships for water supply in 75 villages in central vietnam through a us$4.5 million grant for the east meets west foundation. asian development bank in february 2011 the adb approved a $1bn 10year-facility for water supply in seven or more cities. in december 2015 the adb approved a loan to expand a water treatment plant on the da river to supply hanoi with drinking water, replacing contaminated groundwater that is currently used to supply the city\\'s residents. the loan proceeds will also be used to connect households west of the city along the transmission line from the da river to hanoi. however, in 2016 the hanoi people\\'s committee awarded a licence to build another water treatment plant on the duong river west of the city in an area without a distribution network. the licence was awarded without bidding, using a legal loophole that allows to bypass competitive bidding that is prescribed in a decree on public-private partnerships (ppp) passed as recently as 2015. the private company that received the license is vietnam-oman investment company (voi) - a joint venture of the state general reserve fund of oman, state capital investment corporation of vietnam, state-owned technology enterprise newtatco, vietinbank capital, and the hanoi water limited company (hawacom). references',\n",

       " 'evangelical protestantism is one of five officially recognized faiths in albania. it is a christian faith that views jesus christ as its founder and head, and the bible (especially the new testament) as its written authority. the us international religious freedom report of 2022 noted that 38% of the population (just over a million people) have a christian background. there are 95 christian groups in the country, 174 of which are evangelical. the number of evangelical protestants in albania has risen from approximately 8000 in 1998, to approximately 14,000 in the early 2020s. however, in the 2011 census, 70% of respondents refused to declare belief in any of the listed faiths. unlike other official religions in albania, evangelical protestants are not organized under a hierarchy with an official head, but operate autonomously in separate churches or organizations bearing different denominational or non-denominational names. most, but not all evangelical/protestant groups are members of the albania\\'s evangelical brotherhood (vush), a cooperative organization which views itself as existing as \"an instrument of blessing … with the purpose of promoting unity amongst the churches, representing every local church with dignity, and promoting evangelism.\" protestant denominations include baptist, lutheran and anglican. history on august 26, 1816, robert pinkerton wrote the british and foreign and bible society to encourage them to translate the new testament into albanian. cyrus hamlin reported in 1857 that albanians were applying to his protestant seminary. the first documented albanian protestant was kostandin kristoforidhi, who left his native orthodox faith and converted to protestantism on his own while comparing orthodox, roman catholic and protestant theological texts. he joined the protestant church of smyrna in 1856 or 1857, and was sent to istanbul for theological training. in monastir, gjerasim qiriazi also converted to protestantism ca. 1876-1877, and united with the multi-ethnic protestant church there. the first two known albanian protestant-evangelical churches were both established by gjerasim qiriazi, first in monastir in 1884 and later in korça in 1890 (both cities then part of the ottoman empire). in april 1890, gjerasim qiriazi was ordained as the first albanian evangelist and preacher by the american board of commissioners for foreign missions in the board\\'s annual meeting help in monastir. the second church among albanians was opened in korça. qiriazi was also the head of one of the first national societies within albania, named \"the evangelical brotherhood\". as a result, gjerasim qiriazi is considered as the father of the albanian protestant church. during the communist regime of the late 20th century, albania was declared as the world\\'s first atheist country. over 2,000 religious institutions were closed. several religious leaders and preachers were arrested, imprisoned and executed. it was against the law to buy a bible at that time. when the regime ended in 1991, there were less than 20 evangelical christians in the country. in july, 1991 an international consortium of eleven mission agencies calling themselves the albanian encouragement project (aep) secured government permission to hold an evangelical gathering in tirana. the aep grew to 45 agencies and continued their work there for several years. freedom of religion in 2023, the constitution provides for freedom of religion and conscience. it states that there is no official religion, but officially recognises sunni albanian muslims, bektashi muslims, roman catholics, albanian autocephalous orthodox and vush. in 2022, albania scored 4 out of 4 for religious freedom. see also religion in albania christianity in albania roman catholicism in albania orthodoxy in albania irreligion in albania freedom of religion in albania references further reading hosaflook, david. lëvizja protestante te shqiptarët, 1816-1908. skopje: itshksh, 2019. young, david. lëvizja protestante midis shqiptarëve, 1908-1991. prishtina: tenda, 2011. external links (dedicated to the study and research of protestantism in albania).',\n",

       " 'grodno region, also known as grodno oblast or hrodna voblasts (; ; ), is one of the regions of belarus. it is located in the western part of the country. its administrative center, grodno, is also the largest city in the region. it lies on the neman river. the region borders minsk region to the east, brest region to the south, poland (podlaskie voivodeship) to the west and vitebsk region and lithuania (alytus and vilnius counties) to the north. grodno\\'s existence is attested to from 1127. two castles dating from the 14th to 18th centuries are located here on the steep right bank of the nemen. one of the city\\'s surviving masterpieces is the 12th century orthodox church of st boris & st gleb (kalozhskaya church), which is the second oldest in belarus. history this region was the westernmost \"borderlands\" of the early east slavs (tribal union dregoviches?) on the lands of the balts in the 6th-9th centuries. in the 12th-14th centuries it was part of the area sometimes known as black ruthenia, that was fully incorporated into the grand duchy of lithuania (gdl) by the rulers of lithuania in the 13th century. in 1413, the area around grodno, part of the duchy of trakai, was transformed into newly established trakai voivodeship. grodno became the seat of grodno county. in 1441, magdeburg law charter was granted to the capital by casimir iv jagiellon grand duke of lithuania and future king of poland. in 1444, grodno received its coat of arms from casimir\\'s hands as well as substantial trade privileges. the strong economic development of the area continued during the reign of casimir\\'s son - duke alexander jagiellon who founded the first solid bridge over the neman river as well as monastery of order of saint augustine and monastery of polish ordo fratrum minorum. later, bona sforza queen of poland and grand duchess of lithuania, placed in grodno her royal residence. according to medieval surveys, grodno had 35 streets and 700 houses in 1558. the golden age of grodno falls on the reign of stephen báthory king of poland, which is between 1576 and 1586. during his reign, grodno became royal headquarters and began to host sessions of polish-lithuanian commonwealth senate and parliament. in 1580, on king\\'s order the castle of grodno was rebuilt in renaissance style of architecture, by scoto di parma. at the beginning of the 17th century, grodno was one of the most developed and important cities in polish-lithuanian commonwealth, traditionally recognized as the third capital of the commonwealth. deterioration of province status began with livonian war which put polish-lithuanian commonwealth in long-lasting and exhausting military conflict with tsardom of russia and swedish empire. between 1765 and 1780, the province regained some of its previous status when antoni tyzenhaus the treasurer of the grand duchy of lithuania and administrator of polish royal estates, was governing the capital and the province. around 50 new economical endeavours were undertaken by tyzenhaus in the region, new manufactures, mills and workshops have been built. as part of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth forming the grand duchy\\'s trakai voivodship, and due to subsequent partitions of poland, the whole of the grodno region was finally annexed by russian empire by the end of 1795. the city of grodno then became a seat for grodno governorate. during world war i the governorate was occupied by germany. german troops entered grodno city on 3 september 1915, plundering the library of dominicans order. during the german occupation, polish citizens of grodno region were persecuted and had restricted civil rights. at the end of the war, the belarusian people\\'s republic declared its independence from soviet russia in march 1918 in minsk. grodno was the site of the last stand of the bnr\\'s council (rada). soon, the council was forced to flee as soviet troops invaded the region and the city in 1919. the same year polish-soviet war broke out and lasted until 1921. under the terms of peace treaty of riga the region and the city returned to second polish republic which claimed rights to this territory as a successor to polish-lithuanian commonwealth and as a victorious side of the polish-soviet war. by 1939, the grodno city had 60,000 inhabitants, with poles and jews accounting for 60% and 37% of the population, respectively. during polish rule grodno was centre of grodno county in białystok voivodeship, but some parts of present grodno region was in the voivodeships of nowogródek and wilno. after world war ii started, on 17 september 1939, the grodno area was invaded by soviet union and incorporated by force to the soviet union as part of the byelorussian soviet socialist republic. grodno was located in the newly established belastok region. thousands were imprisoned or deported to siberia or kazakhstan. in the early summer of 1941 the region fell under nazi german occupation. in november 1941, german occupants established the grodno ghetto for jewish citizens of grodno and rest of the region population. in 1942, after a year of severe persecution and planned starvation of ghetto inhabitants, 10,000 jews from grodno were deported to the german concentration camp of auschwitz-birkenau and murdered there. next year, in 1943, survivors of remaining 17,000 of ghetto inhabitants were again deported to auschwitz-birkenau as well as to treblinka extermination camp and białystok ghetto. although on 13 march 1943, german troops reported the end of extermination and described grodno city as judenrein, around 50 jews survived the extermination, also hidden by non-jewish families. polish and soviet underground acted in the region. villages like dziarečyn, which originally had large jewish populations, were greatly reduced. as a result of joseph stalin\\'s policy of expansion to the west, it was decided during the yalta conference that the polish eastern border shall be set along the so-called \"original\" curzon line. based on this decision, the left-bank part of grodno town would be kept within the borders of poland. it is actually not clear till today, how the original curzon line near grodno has been moved by around 20 km to the west. when the so-called \"mistake\" (today regarded rather as sabotage within british ministry structures) became obvious to negotiators, stalin refused to correct the mistaken line. despite multiple and desperate appeals from polish citizens of grodno, the whole grodno region, (including ethically polish till today) sapotskin triangle, was incorporated to the soviet belarus and many poles emigrated or were expelled. in 1944, belastok region was dissolved and grodno region established. since 1991, the grodno region constitutes one of six regions of independent belarus. heritage and tourism main tourist attractions in the region are numerous old architectural constructions such as castles in mir, lida, novogrudok. a part of białowieża forest is situated here, but the tourist excursions start from the brest region part of the national park. zhyrovichy monastery is also a destination for religious travellers. the mir castle complex and belovezhskaya pushcha national park are unesco world heritage sites. there are such objects of belarusian cultural heritage list, as the church of saint anthony of padua in kamienka, st. francis xavier cathedral, st andrew\\'s church in slonim, church of the holy trinity in gierviaty, etc. there are about 45 travel agencies in grodno region, half of them provide agent activity, the other half are tour operators. demographics the province covers an area of 25,100 km2 and has a population of 1,065,100, giving a population density of 42/km2. about 63.5% live in cities and towns, while 36.5% live in rural areas. females account for 53% of the region\\'s population and men 47%. there are about 310,000 children under 19, and about 240,000 people aged

       " '[[file:arc-164-rt.jpg|thumb|200px|uhf-aircraft station an/arc-164 have quick ii]] have quick (also havequick, short hq) is an ecm-resistant frequency-hopping system used to protect military aeronautical mobile (or) radio traffic. since the end of world war ii, u.s. and allied military aircraft have used am radios in the nato harmonised 225-400 mhz uhf band (part of nato b band) for short range air-to-air and ground-to-air communications. during development and the procurement of uhf radios, military planners did not require features to secure communications for aircraft and helicopters from jamming until the post-vietnam war era. progress in electronics in the 1970s reached a point where anyone with an inexpensive radio frequency scanner or receiver set could intercept military communications. once the target frequencies were identified, radio frequency jamming could easily be employed to degrade or completely disable communications. the have quick program was a response to this problem. engineers recognized that newer aircraft radios already included all-channel frequency synthesizers along with keyboards and displays for data entry. the only other system requirements to achieve the desired anti-jam functionality were an accurate clock (for timed synchronization) and a microprocessor to add frequency hopping to existing radios. aircraft and ground radios that employ have quick must be initialized with accurate time of day (tod; usually from a gps receiver), a word of the day (wod), and a net identifier (providing mode selection and multiple networks to use the same word of the day). a word of the day is a transmission security variable that consists of six segments of six digits each. the word of the day is loaded into the radio or its control unit to key the have quick system to the proper hopping pattern, rate, and dwell time. the word of the day, time of day and net identifier are input to a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator that controls the frequency changes. have quick is not an encryption system, though many have quick radios can be used with encryption; e.g. the ky-58 vinson system. have quick is not compatible with sincgars, the vhf - fm radios used by ground forces, which operate in a different radio band and use a different frequency hopping method; however some newer radios support both. particularities a national air force operates generally in a closed common user group. however, deviation to this regulation existed on german territory until 1990. e.g. the hq-user of the german air force in the north of germany, operational subordinated to 2nd allied tactical air force used hq net-group 1, whereas the southern units, subordinated to 4th allied tactical air force, used hq net-group 2. the co-ordination of hq radio frequency channels in the nato-harmonised uhf-band, the design of the so-called hq hop-sets, is provided in nato-europe in responsibility of the nato allied radio frequency agency (arfa) in brussels. for training and exercises, hq operates in peacetime mode with limited frequency access. four net-numbers may be used overlapping in net-group 1 and 2. however, in tactical operation mode this limitation might be lifted. some hq-features are compatible to encryption hardware; e.g. to the ky-58 vinson-family. utilization in the us and nato have quick was well adopted, and as of 2007 is used on nearly all u.s. military and nato aircraft. improvements include have quick ii phase 2, and a \"second generation anti-jam tactical uhf radio for nato\" called saturn\\'\\'. the latter features more complex frequency hopping. see also an/prc-152 an/arc-164 an/prc-117f an/arc-182 an/arc-210 b band (nato) combat-net radio spread spectrum references external links an/arc-164 have quick ii software enables radio family ties airscene have quick ii military radio systems military radio systems of the united states military electronics of the united states',\n",

       " 'the new constitutional liberal party (, ; french: nouveau parti libéral constitutionnel), most commonly known as neo destour, was a tunisian political party founded in 1934 in dar ayed, the house of independence activist ahmed ayed, by a group of tunisian nationalist politicians during the french protectorate. it originated from a split with the destour party. led by habib bourguiba, neo destour became the ruling party upon tunisian independence in 1956. in 1964, it was renamed the socialist destourian party. history the party was formed as a result of a split from the pre-existing destour party in 1934, during the ksar hellal congress of march 2. several leaders were particularly prominent during the party\\'s early years before world war ii: habib bourguiba, mahmoud el materi, tahar sfar, bahri guiga, and salah ben youssef. prior to the split, a younger group of destour members had alarmed the party elders by appealing directly to the populace through their more radical newspaper l\\'action tunisienne. the younger group, many from the provinces, seemed more in tune with a wider spectrum of the country-wide tunisian people, while the party elders represented a more established constituency in the capital city of tunis; yet both groups were proponents of change, either autonomy or independence. the rupture came at the destour party congress of 1934. world war ii at the outbreak of war in 1939, neo-destour leaders, though still untried, were deported to france. however, they were released by the nazis in 1942 following the german occupation of vichy france. hitler then handed them over to the mussolini\\'s fascist government in rome. there the leaders were treated with deference, the fascists hoping to gain support for the axis. bourguiba steadily refused to cooperate. but hussein triki worked with the nazis under neo-destour. after allies\\' advance, victory in el alamein, he escaped to europe, there he worked for the mahgreb, a north african arabic organization working for the nazis\\' war machine against the allies and has collaborated with hitler\\'s ally mufti of palestine. the neo-destour party was one of the arab factions that the nazi germans hoped to win over to the axis side . as majority of its leaders imprisoned by the french, eitel friedrich moellhausen, rahn\\'s deputy, argued that the arabs could be incited to action \"against jews and anglo-saxons\" through the release of the prisoners in marseille, without the germans having to provide specific assurances concerning independence. post wwii eventually the neo destour led the tunisian independence movement after the tumultuous period during world war ii. then bourguiba was imprisoned and after the war in egypt, while ben salih was the local, hands-on party leader. a significant break within the party ranks occurred in the final year of the independence struggle. in april, 1955, salah ben yusuf openly challenged habib bourguiba over his gradualist tactics during his autonomy negotiations with the french. also ben yusuf, who cultivated support at al-zaytuna mosque and took a pan-arab political line, disputed bourguiba\\'s more liberal, secular, pro-western approach. the party\\'s labor leader ahmad ben salah kept the tunisian general labor union in bourguiba\\'s camp. the neo destour party expelled ben yusuf that october; in november 1955 he mounted a large street demonstration but to no avail. ben yusuf then left for nasser\\'s egypt where he was welcomed. independence of tunisia from france was negotiated largely by the neo destour\\'s bourguiba. the effective date was march 20, 1956. the next year the republic of tunisia was constituted, which replaced the beylical form of government. the neo destour became the ruling party under prime minister and later president habib bourguiba. in 1963, the neo destour was proclaimed the only legally permitted party in tunisia, though for all intents and purposes the country had been a one-party state since independence. later the neo destour party was renamed the socialist destourian party (psd in its french acronym) in 1964, to signal the government\\'s commitment to a socialist phase of political-economic development. this phase failed to fulfill expectations, however, and was discontinued in 1969 with the dismissal of ahmad ben salah as economics minister by president bourguiba. in 1988, under president ben ali, the party was again renamed, to become the rassemblement constitutionel démocratique (rcd). the rcd continued as the tunisian ruling party under president ben ali, who became increasingly corrupt and dictatorial. early in 2011 he was forced out of office and his regime and the ruling party abolished, as a result of the liberal tunisian revolution. similar subsequent events of popular regime change, which had spread to other arab countries, became known as the arab spring. electoral history presidential elections chamber of deputies elections notable people hédi saidi see also destour socialist destourian party (psd) democratic constitutional rally (rcd) reference notes 1934 establishments in tunisia 1964 disestablishments in tunisia political parties established in 1934 political parties disestablished in 1964 destourian parties defunct political parties in tunisia parties of one-party systems',\n",

of persistent convection over the caroline islands, mike was first designated on november 6, 1990 and moved generally westward. later that day, the depression strengthened to tropical storm mike near yap. mike became a typhoon early on november 9, and subsequently entered a period of rapid deepening. late on november 10, the typhoon reached its maximum intensity of , as estimated by the japanese meteorological agency. after weakening slightly, mike made landfall in the central philippines. the storm weakened considerably due to land interaction, only to briefly re-intensify on november 14. typhoon mike turned west-northwest and later north-northwest, avoiding land interaction with vietnam. vertical wind shear increased, and on november 15, mike weakened below typhoon intensity. early the next day, the storm passed over western hainan island, and degraded to a tropical depression that night. after briefly emerging into the gulf of tonkin, mike passed over northern vietnam and southern china, where it dissipated on november 18. during its formative stages, mike passed just north of palau. there, one person was hurt and around 90% of the banana and coconut crops were leveled. a total of 1,035 houses and 10 businesses were damaged. damage on the island totaled $2 million, including $1.3 million in property damage. after striking the philippines, the typhoon brought widespread damage and was considered the worst typhoon to hit the country since typhoon ike in 1984. in cebu city, 88 ships sunk, the most ships ever sunk at the cebu city harbor during a tropical cyclone. power and phone lines were downed and the city lost access to drinking water for two days. approximately 60% of all buildings were demolished and 28 people perished in the city. nationwide, 748 people were killed while 1,274 others suffered injuries. a total of 1,900,000 t (2,094,390 short tons) of sugar crops were destroyed. a total of 630,885 homes were damaged and 222,026 houses were demolished, resulting in 1,110,020 people displaced. offshore, 159 vessels sunk and 28 others were washed aground and damaged. monetary damage was estimated at $446 million (₱10.8 billion), including $46.1 million (₱1.12 billion) from crops, $350 million (₱8.52 billion) from public infrastructure, and $49.9 million (₱1.21 billion) from private infrastructure. at the time, mike was the costliest tropical cyclone listed in the national disaster risk reduction and management council's database, and as of 2014, is the seventh costliest typhoon to strike the country since independence in 1947. elsewhere, 68 people were killed in vietnam, but no damage was reported in china. meteorological history typhoon mike originated from a persistent area of convection that was first monitored by the joint typhoon warning center (jtwc) early on november 6. at midday, the japan meteorological agency (jma) followed suit. at 15:03 utc on november 6, the jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert,

       " 'the public eye is a 1992 american crime thriller film produced by sue baden-powell and written and directed by howard franklin, starring joe pesci and barbara hershey. stanley tucci and richard schiff appear in supporting roles. the film is loosely based on new york daily news photographer arthur \"weegee\" fellig, and some of the photos in the film were taken by fellig. plot in the 1940s, leon \"bernzy\" bernstein is a freelance crime and street photographer for the new york city tabloids, dedicated to his vivid and realistic work and his unique ability to capture shots that nobody else can. he is very confident of his skills, declaring at one point, \"nobody does what i do. nobody\". with a police radio under the dashboard of his car and a makeshift darkroom in his trunk, he quickly races to the scene of horrific crimes and accidents in order to snap exclusive photographs. he is so good at his job that he becomes known affectionately as the \"great bernzini\". bernzy meets a sultry widow, kay levitz, who owns a fancy nightclub. it seems the mob is muscling in on her due to some arrangement with her late husband. kay asks if bernzy could investigate an individual she considers troublesome. generally unsuccessful with women, bernzy agrees to help kay, and he slowly begins to fall in love with her. after talking to his contacts, including journalist friend arthur nabler, he tracks down kay\\'s man, only to find him murdered. but when he calls the police, he becomes a suspect in the man\\'s death. the police and the fbi are also very interested in this case. bernstein makes a connection with a local gangster, sal, uncovering a conspiracy involving a mob turf war about illegal gas rationing, and the federal government. his activities get sal killed and place bernzy\\'s life in great danger as he waits in hiding at an italian restaurant where a mob hit is about to take place. cast joe pesci as leon \"bernzy\" bernstein barbara hershey as

production joe pesci took this role right after his oscar-winning performance in goodfellas. it was an attempt to capitalize on his popularity at the time and help elevate pesci from respected character actor to star status. director and writer howard franklin was unable to secure the rights to arthur \"weegee\" fellig\\'s story. franklin, then, wrote the story of a weegee-like photographer who smokes cigars and he named him leon \"bernzy\" bernstein. in the film, like weegee, cops wonder if bernzy uses a ouija board to snap his photographs and find the stories. according to journalist doug trapp, franklin was inspired to write the screenplay after seeing a show of fellig\\'s photos in the 1980s at the international center of photography in new york city. and weegee did, in real life, have a \"soul-mate\" named wilma wilcox, who was the woman in charge of his estate. but, franklin has always denied that the film was about their relationship. as the film is loosely modelled on weegee, but the story is not, several photographers\\' pictures, along with some by weegee, stand in for his work, including those of lisette model, mickey pallas, wilbert h. blanche, irving haberman, ray platnick, roger smith and charles steinheimer. director franklin says he was looking for \"edgy, modern, high-contrast 40\\'s\" lighting and compositions with the \"stark, rather lurid effects of flash, which pick out the central subject while everything around falls off rapidly into darkness\" filming the public eye began filming on july 24, 1991 and completed october 28, 1991. even though the film takes place in manhattan, it was shot in chicago, illinois, cincinnati, ohio, and los angeles, california. release the producers used the following tagline when marketing the film: murder. scandal. crime. no matter what he was shooting, \"the great bernzini\" never took sides he only took pictures ... except once. the film premiered at the toronto festival of festivals in september 1992. the film also was shown at the venice film festival and the valladolid international film festival in spain. it opened on october 14, 1992 in new york city and los angeles and expanded to 635

was released in video format on april 14, 1993 and in laserdisc on april 21, 1993. in september 2007 an unbox digital video download was made available. the movie is also available at amazon.com as digital video on demand. it was released on dvd on january 31, 2011 in the universal vault series. it was released on blu-ray from kino lorber on july 28, 2020. reception critical response chicago sun-times film critic, roger ebert, was especially complimentary of the film and of actor joe pesci, and wrote, \"one of the best things about the movie is the way it shows us how seriously bernzy takes his work. he doesn\\'t talk about it. he does it, with that cigar stuck in his mug, leading the way with the big, ungainly speed graphic with the glass flashbulbs. in the movie\\'s big scene of

atmospheric film noir, full of intrigue, romance and street toughness. but it\\'s all flash and no picture. despite the usual quippy, perky performance from pesci, as well as cinematographer peter suschitzky\\'s moodily delineated images, the movie is superficial and unengaging. it\\'s as if life magazine decided to make an oldtime gangster movie.\" soundtrack the original score for the film was written and recorded by jerry goldsmith, but he was replaced by mark isham at a late stage. as such, isham had a lot of work to do and in a short time. he later noted that he found working with director franklin a wonderful and educational experience. a motion picture original soundtrack was released on october 13, 1992 under the varèse sarabande label. the cd contained nineteen tracks in total, with one by shorty rogers. mark isham crafts a dark melody focusing on piano, string, and trumpet parts, while mixing in symphonic, jazz, and electronic music. while originally thought lost or incomplete, jerry goldsmith\\'s original score was later released by intrada records in 2021. goldsmith\\'s score features 22 tracks and a run time of just over 40 minutes, proving its completion

       " 'in grammar, the ablative case (pronounced ; sometimes abbreviated ) is a grammatical case for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives in the grammars of various languages; it is sometimes used to express motion away from something, among other uses. the word \"ablative\" derives from the latin , the (irregular) perfect, passive participle of auferre \"to carry away\". the ablative case is found in several language families, such as indo-european (e.g., sanskrit, latin, albanian, armenian), turkic (e.g., turkish, turkmen, azerbaijani, uzbek, kazakh, kyrgyz, tatar), tungusic (e.g., manchu, evenki), uralic (e.g., hungarian), and the dravidian languages. there is no ablative case in modern germanic languages such as german and english. there was an ablative case in the early stages of ancient greek, but it quickly fell into disuse by the classical period. indo-european languages latin the ablative case in latin (cāsus ablātīvus) appears in various grammatical constructions, including following various prepositions, in an ablative absolute clause, and adverbially. the latin ablative case was derived from three proto-indo-european cases: ablative (from), instrumental (with), and locative (in/at). greek in ancient greek, there was an ablative case ( ) which was used in the homeric, pre-mycenaean, and mycenean periods. it fell into disuse during the classical period and thereafter with some of its functions taken by the genitive and others by the dative. the genitive case with the prepositions \"away from\" and \"out of\" is an example. german german does not have an ablative case but, exceptionally, latin ablative case-forms were used from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century after some prepositions, for example after von in von dem nomine: ablative of the latin loanword nomen. grammarians at that time, justus georg schottel, kaspar von stieler (\"der spate\"), johann balthasar von antesperg and johann christoph gottsched, listed an ablative case (as the sixth case after nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and vocative) for german words. they arbitrarily considered the dative case after some prepositions to be an ablative, as in (\"from the man\" or \"of the man\") and (\"with the man\"), while they considered the dative case after other prepositions or without a preposition, as in , to be a dative. albanian the ablative case is found in albanian; it is the fifth case, rasa rrjedhore. sanskrit in sanskrit, the ablative case is the fifth case (pañcamī) and has a similar function to that in latin. sanskrit nouns in the ablative often refer to a subject \"out of\" which or \"from\" whom something (an action, an object) has arisen or occurred: pátram taróḥ pátati \"the leaf falls from the tree\". it is also used for nouns in several other senses, as for actions occurring \"because of\" or \"without\" a certain noun, indicating distance or direction. when it appears with a comparative adjective, (śreṣṭhatamam, \"the best\"), the ablative is used to refer to what the adjective is comparing: \"better than x\". armenian the modern armenian ablative has different markers for each main dialect, both originating from classical armenian. the western armenian affix -է -ē (definite -էն -ēn) derives from the classical singular; the eastern armenian affix -ից -ic\\' (both indefinite and definite) derives from the classical plural. for both dialects, those affixes are singular, with the corresponding plurals being -(ն)երէ(ն) and -(ն)երից . the ablative case has several uses. its principal function is to show \"motion away\" from a location, point in space or time: it also shows the agent when it is used with the passive voice of the verb: it is also used for comparative statements in colloquial armenian (including infinitives and participles): finally, it governs certain postpositions: uralic languages finnish in finnish, the ablative case is the sixth of the locative cases with the meaning \"from, off, of\": pöytä - pöydältä \"table - off from the table\". it is an outer locative case, used like the adessive and allative cases, to denote both being on top of something and \"being around the place\" (as opposed to the inner locative case, the elative, which means \"from out of\" or \"from the inside of\"). with the locative, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it. the finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate times of something happening (kymmeneltä \"at ten\") as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions. the finnish ablative has the ending -lta or -ltä, depending on vowel harmony. usage away from a place katolta: off the roof pöydältä: off the table rannalta: from the beach maalta: from the land mereltä: from the sea from a person, object or other entity häneltä: from him/her/them with the verb lähteä (stop) lähteä tupakalta: stop smoking (in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now, lit. \\'leave from the tobacco\\') lähteä hippasilta: stop playing tag (hippa=tag, olla hippasilla=playing tag) to smell/taste/feel/look/sound like something haisee pahalta: smells bad maistuu hyvältä: tastes good tuntuu kamalalta: feels awful näyttää tyhmältä: looks stupid kuulostaa mukavalta: sounds nice estonian the ablative case in estonian is the ninth case and has a similar function to that in hungarian. hungarian the ablative case in hungarian is used to describe movement away from, as well as a concept, object, act or event originating from an object, person, location or entity. for example, one walking away from a friend who gave him a gift could say the following: a barátomtól jövök (i am coming (away) from my friend). a barátomtól kaptam egy ajándékot (i got a gift from my friend). when used to describe movement away from a location, the case may only refer to movement from the general vicinity of the location and not from inside of it. thus, a postától jövök would mean one had been standing next to the post office before, not inside the building. when the case is used to refer to the origin of a possible act or event, the act/event may be implied while not explicitly stated, such as : i will defend you from the robber. the application of vowel harmony gives two different suffixes: -tól and -től. these are applied to back-vowel and front-vowel words, respectively. hungarian has a narrower delative case, similar to ablative, but more specific: movement off/from a surface of something, with suffixes -ról and -ről. turkic languages azerbaijani the ablative in azerbaijani () is expressed through the suffixes -dan or -dən: ev - evdən house - from/off the house aparmaq - aparmaqdan to carry - from/off carrying tatar the ablative in tatar () is expressed through the suffixes -дан or -дән or -тан or -тән or -нан or -нән: өй - өйдән house - from/off the house turkish the ablative in turkish (-den hali or ayrılma hali) is expressed through the suffix -den (which changes to -dan, -ten or -tan to accommodate the vowel and voicing harmony): ev - evden house - from/off the house at - attan horse - from/off the horse taşımak - taşımaktan to carry - from/off carrying ses - sesten sound/volume - from/off sound/volume in some situations simple ablative can have a \"because of\" meaning; in these situations, ablative can be optionally followed by the postposition dolayı \"because of\". yüksek sesten (dolayı) rahatsız oldum. / i was uneasy because of high volume. tungusic manchu the ablative in manchu is expressed through the suffix -ci and can also be used to express comparisons. it is usually not directly attached to its parent word. evenki the ablative in evenki is expressed with the suffix -duk. see also allative case delative case locative case further reading references grammatical cases',\n",

       " 'rank 1 is a dutch trance group, formed in the netherlands in 1997. widely regarded as one of the originators of the dutch trance sound, the group have produced a number of dancefloor hits since their conception. although the two members of the group (benno de goeij and piet bervoets) had worked together before, rank 1 (a name first used in 1999) was their first project with commercial success. history the first rank 1 release was an ep containing \"the citrus juicer\" and \"black snow\". their biggest hit commercially was the 1999 track that followed up to that ep called \"airwave\", which reached no. 10 in the uk singles chart and no. 25 in the u.s. billboard hot dance club play chart. this was later re-released by rank 1 remixed with added vocals as \"breathing (airwave 2003)\", rank 1 followed it up 11 years later with a modern style remix of airwave in 2014 bringing the trance juggernaut into the 21st century. they also provided the base for a mash up with donna williams, as \"true love never dies\", which was later vocally re-recorded using kelly llorenna, by flip & fill. in 2011, airwave was voted the number 1 trance classic of all time in the trance top 1000 poll. in 2013, airwave reached number 7. later in 2021, airwave was ranked 15 in the a state of trance top 1000 list. in september 2000, they performed the track \"many miles too soon\" live at trance energy as a tribute to the late miles stutterheim, younger brother to duncan stutterheim, one of the founders of the dutch event organiser id&t. a year later this track was released as \"such is life\", with added vocals by shanokee and chosen as the anthem of sensation 2001, the first edition where visitors were asked to appear dressed in white. a year later they released \"awakening\" as the single preceding their debut album \"symsonic\". the album was released with a cd containing downtempo versions of airwave and such is life as well as a some brand new tracks including the title track, a short version of \"the citrus juicer\", \"t.t.c.\", \"passage to the unknown\", \"still in my mind\" and more. the album also included a dvd with a few videoclips of their singles up till then as well as their live performance at trance energy 2002. 2003 saw the re-release of airwave with vocals by aino laos which were written by jan lochel. in a recorded interview, benno explained that breathing was released to back up the album release in germany. by the end of the year, rank 1 finally released their single symsonic under the new title \"it\\'s up to you\", with added vocals by shanokee. unlike the classically inspired album version, these mixes were produced in the more typical 4x4 driven uplifting trance style, especially the \"instrumental dub\" and \"dub vocal mix\". the next year saw the release of the symsonic album sampler titled \"unreleased tracks\" which contained extended mixes of \"conspiracy\", \"cosmomatic\" and \"down from the deep\". shortly thereafter, rank 1 radically changed their trademark euphoric sound and released an ep containing \"beats at rank-1 dotcom\", a brand new tech trance record which id&t would later pick up as the trance energy 2005 theme. the flipside contained \"after me\", a breaks driven string-laced track. the male vocals on this track were rumored to have been performed by benno de goeij himself. this would be the start of rank 1\\'s radical sound shift every few years which would lead to some genre-blending releases. in february 2005, rank 1 performed live at trance energy for the third time. during this live show they performed a track which was only made for the event. however, the crowd\\'s reaction to it was so immense that piet and benno decided to release it as an official track called \"top gear\". this would happen over the summer with another two-track ep: \"opus 17\" was present at the flipside and was a moody trance track unlike its unique heavy techno-techtrance influenced b-side. in february 2006, piet was interviewed for a wildchild event. in this interview he stated that their second album was in progress and that they had made quite some diverse tunes for it, including a breaks track with the potential title \"2 drunk 2 funk\". as of 2017, this track has not been revealed yet. piet also clarified about the mysterious unreleased and untitled \"rank 1 vs. marco v\" collaboration track that was also mentioned in the faq section of their old website. there were no official single releases during 2006 but in 2007 both \"this world is watching me\" (with armin van buuren and kush) and \"life less ordinary\" (with alex m.o.r.p.h.) were released. both tracks mixed electro-driven beats with trancey strings and saw yet another sound shift from rank 1. life less ordinary also received an experimental rank 1 interpretation in the guise of \"a less ordinary rank 1 remix\". early 2008 saw them release another electro-style collaboration, this time it was a collaboration with jochen miller, titled \"and then...\". rank 1 made an own version of the track which they titled \"rank 1\\'s minimal progressive techno electro trance mix\". it was darker and heavier than the original and had a more techno-driven twist. the duos\\' track: \"l.e.d there be light\", was chosen as the trance energy 2009 anthem, as well as the background track to the 2009 electric daisy carnival commercial. this track combined the soft-loud synth dynamic from and then with sweeping strings and more trancey elements. it leaked out in late 2008, which led to the early release of the \"special download mix\". the track was officially released in february 2009, with remixes by wippenberg, marcel woods as well as an alternative \"laserlight rework\" by rank 1 themselves. in 2010, the song was formally remixed by cold blank. it is the most successful remix to date, reaching no. 10 on beatport\\'s top 100 electro house chart. it also landed a release on ministry of sound\\'s trance nation 2010 compilation. there were also released some another remixes by tydi & trent mcdermott, yvan & dan daniel and loko. their next track, \"symfo,\" was the self-titled sunrise festival theme 2009 and was released only five months after l.e.d. there be light. this track received remixes by marcus schossow and the prime sins, as well as a more house-driven \"rank 1\\'s that side mix\". in 2010, rank 1 and miller released another collaboration which was chosen as the theme to the polish entrance 2010 event called \"the great escape\". armin van buuren even played it during his short satellite-connection gig during trance energy 2010. on february 11, benno tweeted there would be an alternative non-trance rank 1 remix of the great escape but as of 2017, this version has not been revealed yet. whether it has been cancelled or not remains unclear. two weeks later, benno tweeted that they would start their own radioshow. indeed, april 6 saw the start of their monthly one-hour radioshow \"rank 1\\'s radio rush\" on afterhours fm, which is aired every first tuesday of the month between 20:00 - 21:00 cet. a forum on the rank 1 hyve contains an updated track list of all the episodes, as well as a list of the (old) rank 1 classics played so far. as the summer approached, another collaboration saw the light of day, this time rank 1 teamed up with nic chagall and wippenberg to release \"100\", the self-explanatory track to celebrate high contrast recordings reaching the 100th milestone release. the vinyl release of the track was a limited edition pressed on gold. similar to 2006, 2011 saw no official single releases. the two singles to follow this \"radio silence\" were released in february and march respectively, with the trouse driven \"wild and perfect day\" providing their third collaboration with jochen miller (with vocal support by sarah bettens) whilst \"witness\" was their vocal trance collaboration in tandem with cerf, mitiska & jaren. on april 23 the guys announced they had almost finished a brand new track, so far without vocals. after various cryptic facebook and twitter updates alike, on the 15th of october they finally revealed that their third 2012 release would be a rank 1 solo track called \"7 instead of 8\". the single\\'s title refers to its 7/8 time signature. on december 21, they revealed a 30-second snippet of their collaboration \\'elements of nature\\' with belgium trance artist m.i.k.e. this collaboration was initiated by a twitter user under the name \\'ramballo\\'. this single was released by the end of january 2013 and received much positive feedback for its classic trance vibe and was even rated an 8.5/10 by the dj mag. on march 13, conjure one revealed that a rank 1 remix for his new single \"under the gun\" would debut during rank 1\\'s set at asot 600 in mumbai. just one day later, rank 1 themselves announced a brand new single \\'floorlifter\\' to debut on the very same event. a month later the rank 1 remix for italian trance artist giuseppe ottaviani\\'s single \\'love will bring it all around\\' was released. over the course of the summer, rank 1 announced to be working on a third single. as october passed by, they revealed their new single titled \\'13.11.11\\' which combined the track\\'s duration with its release date and tempo. their first 2014 single was released on march 17, a collaboration with the german producer dennis sheperd titled \\'freudenrausch\\'. on august 8, their track airwave was re-released in a modern 129 bpm rework to celebrate 15 years of the rank 1 project: \\'airwave (21st century mix)\\' peaked at 4 in the beatport trance top 100 chart. on december 16, di.fm aired the 56th radio rush episode, which was also the radioshow\\'s finale. early 2015 saw m.i.k.e. share an instagram picture of a project he was working on: the title of the project read \"mikepush vs rank1 - juno tracks\". on june 18, this collaboration was revealed as the guys\\' newest collaboration \"juno\". it debuted on episode 718 of armin van buuren\\'s a state of trance radioshow as \\'tune of the week\\'. on september 13 both rank 1 and m.i.k.e. tweeted the same cryptic message: a google search of the sentences they both used seemed to be referring to zenith. a couple of weeks later it turned out that the guys had indeed teamed up again for a third collaboration which they named \"zenith\": it was premiered by markus schulz on his global dj broadcast radioshow. it would go on to garner massive support from markus throughout the next few months. at the end of may 2016, rank 1 used a cryptic tweet to reveal a new single: it merely read \"03.06.2016\" and was accompanied by coverart depicting a highway at dawn. in the following days, they revealed they had finished a brand new rework of their old 2000 remix for cygnus x - superstring. armin van buuren granted them tune of the week status once more on asot 766 and during the episode, benno gave a short background story on the track: the piano they used in superstring was the same one that armin used to play as a child. a month later, torsten stenzel, better known as york, released his album traveller which featured a collaboration with rank 1 titled \"this world is so amazing\", alongside vocals by lola grover, the collaboration was officially released on november 1. the package included remixes by maglev and dreamy alongside the original mix. a few silent months followed. then, on july 7, 2017, rank 1 revealed that they would be part of the dreamstate socal line-up, a multi-day trance event that would take place in the final weekend of november. on saturday november 25th their first live performance in 4,5 years time took place and the guys seized the opportunity to showcase four brand new tracks alongside the untitled track they performed over various festivals during summer \\'12. as of december 9, no new material has been released. on july 27, 2018, cosmic gate released their remix of l.e.d. there be light, but other than that there were no new releases that year. when 2019 had got underway, the guys released a brand new single at last: for this occasion they finally delivered a collaboration with marco v which they titled \"we finally met\". it was premiered on asot episode 902 on february 21 and was made tune of the week by armin. it was the only release they put out in 2019. for the celebration of the 950th episode of his radioshow, armin decided he wanted to do something special so he asked piet & benno if they were interested in doing a liveshow at the jaarbeurs to which they agreed. two and a half years onward from dreamstate the guys went live again, albeit this time they combined the live playing with some mega-mixing tricks to fit 11 tracks into 30 minutes: they played two brand new untitled tracks, as well as two tracks from their dreamstate show. on july 31, the live set was released on spotify and with it, the previously untitled tracks finally received names. in order of appearance, these were: \"transatlantic communication\", \"predictive memory\", \"no name\" and \"paris nice cannes\". over the course of july 2021, 15 years after this world is watching me, armin and rank 1 released a second collaboration titled \\'the greater light to rule the night\\'. it was premiered on a state of trance 1027 as tune of the week. around mid-april 2022, armin announced his upcoming mix compilation a state of trance 2022 which would premiere aly & fila and jes - sunrise (rank 1 remix). it was the first rank 1 remix in nine years, the last one being love will bring it all around in 2013. discography albums 2002 symsonic including \"symsonic\", \"cosmomatic\", \"conspiracy\",

       " 'cristoforo moro (1390 - november 10, 1471) was the 67th doge of venice. he reigned from 1462 to 1471. family the moro family settled in venice in the 5th century when stephanus maurus, a great-grandson of maurus, built a church on the island of murano. cristoforo was the eleventh person from the family to be elected doge. his dogaressa was cristina sanudo. life after graduating from university, moro held various public offices. he was the venetian ambassador to the popes eugene iv and nicholas v. saint bernardino of siena was said to have prophesied that moro would one day become doge, and as the fulfillment of a solemn vow moro had the church of saint giobbe built and dedicated to bernardino\\'s memory. he bequeathed his fortune to various charitable organizations and foundations, including the church of saint giobbe. doge moro\\'s reign was marked by the beginning of a long war between venice and the turks. in 1463 pope pius ii sent moro a consecrated sword with the intention of convincing venice to join the anti-turk alliance. the reaction in venice was initially hesitant as the republic\\'s main priority was their economic interests. in april 1463, 10 years after the conquest of constantinople, turkish troops occupied the venetian fortress of argos in greece. the latin patriarch cardinal johannes bessarion traveled to venice to call on the republic to join the \"defense of the faith\"; i.e. join the war against the turks. that same year a coalition was formed between venice, hungary and the albanian prince skanderbeg with the blessing of the pope to counter the threat of sultan mehmed ii\\'s aggressive policy of conquest. the coalition succeeded in temporarily halting turkish expansion; however, the new territorial limits acquired by the turks in their conquests had by and large been accepted. in 1469 the venetian fleet commander niccolò canal retook the town of ainos in thrace, but he was not able to defend the island of negroponte (euboea), a major granary of venice, from turkish attack. euboea was conquered by the sultan while inflicting enormous losses on the venetian forces. the republic faced further threats from the northern italian cities who coveted venetian land, as well as from the french king louis xi who was seeking to expand lombardy at the expense of venice. tomb moro\\'s tomb is located in the sanctuary of the church of saint giobbe. the tomb is above ground, covered with a marble tombstone. references bibliography 1390 births 1471 deaths 15th-century doges of venice ambassadors of the republic of venice to the holy see medieval italian diplomats republic of venice people of the ottoman-venetian wars 15th-century diplomats',\n",

       " 'sir william kennedy reid kcb (born 15 february 1931) is a retired civil servant who was parliamentary commissioner for administration and health service commissioner for england, scotland and wales (parliamentary and health service ombudsman) between 1990 and 1996. reid was born in aberdeen in 1931 and was educated at robert gordon\\'s college and george watson\\'s college. he studied at edinburgh university and trinity college, cambridge, where he achieved first-class honours in classics. between 1952 and 1954, reid did national service in the british army before joining the ministry of education in 1956. he moved to the cabinet office in 1964 and served as secretary to the cabinet secretary, sir burke trend. during this time, reid played a modest role in helping to develop the office of parliamentary ombudsman. in 1967, he became secretary of the council for scientific policy in the department of education and science, becoming under secretary in 1974 and then accountant-general in 1976. reid moved to the scottish office in 1978 as deputy secretary of central services and then secretary of the scottish home and health department between 1984 and 1990. he was chairman of governors of the scottish police college between 1984 and 1990. reid received an honorary doctorate from [aberdeen university in 1996, from reading university in 1998 and from napier university in 1998. ombudsman parliamentary investigations in 1990, reid was the first civil servant to be appointed to the post of ombudsman since sir idwal pugh. he came to the office when it was flushed with the success of the barlow clowes investigation, which crowned an otherwise quiet decade in which fewer mps were referring cases. reid oversaw a dramatic upswing in caseload during his tenure - from 704 complaints in 1990 to 1,920 in 1996, the largest annual total in the history of the office. yet the office did not keep up with this growth, and the number of outstanding cases grew considerably. the remit of the ombudsman extended appreciably, to incorporate administrative actions of persons appointed by the lord chancellor as a member of court administrative staff. the office also had numerous tribunals brought within its jurisdiction, as well as bodies such as the national lottery, the coal authority, the environment agency and the rail regulator. reid chose to expand on the meaning of the term maladministration, a term given no definition in the parliamentary commissioner act 1967 in his annual report of 1993. he observed that to define maladministration is to limit it and extended the \\'crossman catalogue\\' (as set out in 1966) to include rudeness; an unwillingness to treat an individual as a person with rights; a refusal to answer reasonable questions; neglecting to inform an individual on request of his or her rights or entitlement; knowingly giving advice which is misleading or inadequate; ignoring valid advice or overruling considerations which would produce an uncomfortable result for the person overruling; offering no redress or manifestly disproportionate redress; showing bias whether because of colour, sex, or any other grounds; an omission to notify those who thereby lost a right of appeal; a refusal to inform adequately of the right of appeal; faulty procedures; the failure to monitor compliance with adequate procedures; cavalier disregard of guidance which was intended to be followed in the interest of the equitable treatment of those who use a service; partiality; and failure to mitigate the effects of rigid adherence to the letter of the law where that produces manifestly inequitable treatment. reid\\'s addendum made apparent his belief that maladministration should be interpreted very broadly and that it should not be interpreted in a way that disadvantaged the complainant. some notable cases were investigation during reid\\'s time as ombudsman. a widely publicised statement by the parliamentary under secretary for health, edwina currie, that \"most of the egg production\" of the country was \"sadly... infected with salmonella\" sparked a collapse in the price of eggs and confidence crisis in the industry in december 1988. the government introduced a compensation scheme and a farmer complained that the ministry of agriculture, fisheries and food (maff) had changed the basis of awarding compensation after giving him what he regarded as an unsatisfactory amount. reid found that maff had not made its decisions on the basis of evidence, had been evasive when questioned about the basis on which compensation was determined and had unreasonably concluded that the complainant\\'s case was closed. in consequence, maff apologised and agreed to pay compensation to the complainant. reid received many complaints of maladministration by the child support agency, which had been set up in 1993 to assess, collect and enforce child support maintenance. such was the volume of complaints that reid took the unprecedented step of not investigating individual complaints unless they involved an aspect of the agency\\'s work which was previously unknown or involved actual financial loss. reid uncovered a litany of administrative woes when he reported in 1995: mistaken identity, inadequate procedures, failure to answer correspondence, incorrect or misleading advice, delay in the assessment and review of child support maintenance, and in its payment to the parent with care. complaints about the agency continued to reach the office, making up a third of all cases admitted for investigation. reid reported again in march 1996, finding that shortcomings continued to occur. the select committee criticised the agency for failing to heed the advice of reid\\'s reports. it was necessary for reid to lay a report under s10(3) parliamentary commissioner act 1967 when the government refused to accept his findings in respect of complaints about blight caused by the construction of the channel tunnel rail link. residents in kent complained that the handling of the project by the department of transport had caused the value of their properties to depreciate to the extent that they could not sell them. in february 1995, reid issued his report, finding that the department had maladministered in not considering the effects of its policy on those affected by it. reid commented that the project had been kept in limbo, increasing uncertainty and blight. the government did not accept the findings but after the select committee intervened on the side of the ombudsman, it decided to reconsider whether to establish a compensation scheme out of respect for the pca select committee and the office of the parliamentary commissioner. nevertheless, the government refused to admit fault or liability and ultimately, 28 applicants received £10,000 in compensation. health investigations reid was health service ombudsman at a time of significant organisational change for the national health service on the basis of the internal market principles introduced by the government. after 1994, the work of the office under reid was dominated by the decision of the government to establish a unified complaints system for the national health service and to extend the jurisdiction of the ombudsman to encompass matters of clinical judgment. successive ombudsmen had expressed misgivings that such a large proportion of complaints received about health authorities concerned clinical judgment. although there was often a thin line between clinical and administrative decisions, reid undertook to press his jurisdiction as far as he could. in 1993, the wilson committee recommended that the government carefully examine whether the ombudsman ought to consider complaints about clinical judgment. in 1995, the government published its proposals which incorporated the suggestion of the wilson report. the subsequent health service commissioners (amendment) act 1996 which enabled the ombudsman to investigate clinical judgment received all-party support. reid oversaw the office\\'s adaptation to the new legislation. the task was complicated considerably by its unpredictable effects on caseload. precise figures for extra workload arising from my wider jurisdiction observed reid, are impossible to predict. reid also undertook to recruit and train the additional staff necessary to cope with the increased workload and extended remit. reid laid down that the office\\'s clinical advisers would be expected to have due regard to all professional guidance in determining what a reasonable and responsible clinical decision and reach their conclusions on the balance of probabilities. when reid departed the office, it was well placed to handle the dramatically increasing workload which would soon be dominated by matters of clinical judgment. reid also undertook an investigation of the complaints handling system of the salford royal hospitals trust. reid described salford as useful peg on which a whole report about the nhs could be hung upon. an unprecedented number of complaints had been received about salford. reid concluded damningly that incoming and outgoing letters went astray. doctors did not always respond to requests... as quickly as they should have done. it took too long to reply to complaints... no real thought appeared to have been given to measures which might improve service and reduce the pressure on staff. the select committee recommended that reid\\'s report be used throughout the nhs for the training of new staff in the complaints procedure. overview although the period of reid\\'s tenure as health service ombudsman was one in which there was enormous changes within the national health service (what reid called a state of flux), it has been observed that the office came through the state of flux and emerged not only intact but significantly strengthened. reid\\'s elaboration on the meaning of maladministration served to remind public authorities that the interpretation of the term would not be to the disadvantage of the complainant and that the office expected the highest standards of public administration. he cultivated relationships with ombudsmen overseas, becoming a director of the international ombudsman institute between 1992 and 1996. post-ombudsman following his service as ombudsman, reid was appointed chairman of the mental welfare commission for scotland in 1997. he was also appointed chairman of the advisory committee on distinction awards for doctors and dentists. he served in both roles until 2000. reid\\'s book, resolving complaints and promoting openness: can the ombudsman help?, was published in 1998. reid was sydenham lecturer of the worshipful society of apothecaries of london in 1994, the crookshank lecturer of the royal college of radiologists in 1994 and the john hunt lecturer of the royal college of general practitioners in 1996. classical and modern languages, verse and hillwalking are among his leisure pursuits. he is a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh, a fellow of the royal college of physicians of edinburgh and an honorary fellow of the royal college of surgeons of edinburgh. references military personnel from aberdeen 20th-century british army personnel british army soldiers ombudsmen in the united kingdom people from

       " \"in greek mythology, nice (ancient greek: νίκη means 'victory') was a thespian princess as one of the 50 daughters of king thespius and megamede, daughter of arneus (or by one of his many wives). she bore nicodromus to the hero heracles. mythology when the cithaeronian lion was harassing the kine of thespius, the latter asked herakles to kill the lion. the son of zeus hunted it for fifty days and finally slayed the beast. the thespian king entertained him as a guest in a brilliant fashion during that span of time. heracles was drunk and slept unwittingly with each of the king's fifty daughters, including nice, thinking that his bed-fellow was always the same. thespius intended this to happen because he strongly desired that all his daughters should have children by hercules. in another version of the myth, the latter had an intercourse with nice and her siblings for one week; seven laid with heracles each night. in some accounts, heracles bedded in a single night with nice and her sisters except for one who refused to have a connection with him. the hero thinking that he had been insulted, condemned her to remain a virgin all her life, serving him as his priest. notes references apollodorus, the library with an english translation by sir james george frazer, f.b.a., f.r.s. in 2 volumes, cambridge, ma, harvard university press; london, william heinemann ltd. 1921. isbn 0-674-99135-4. online version at the perseus digital library. greek text available from the same website. athenaeus of naucratis, the deipnosophists or banquet of the learned. london. henry g. bohn, york street, covent garden. 1854. online version at the perseus digital library. athenaeus of naucratis, deipnosophistae. kaibel. in aedibus b.g. teubneri. lipsiae. 1887. greek text available at the perseus digital library. diodorus siculus, the library of history translated by charles henry oldfather. twelve volumes. loeb classical library. cambridge, massachusetts: harvard university press; london: william heinemann, ltd. 1989. vol. 3. books 4.59-8. online version at bill thayer's web site diodorus siculus, bibliotheca historica. vol 1-2. immanel bekker. ludwig dindorf. friedrich vogel. in aedibus b. g. teubneri. leipzig. 1888-1890. greek text available at the perseus digital library. pausanias, description of greece with an english translation by w.h.s. jones, litt.d., and h.a. ormerod, m.a., in 4 volumes. cambridge, ma, harvard university press; london, william heinemann ltd. 1918. . online version at the perseus digital library pausanias, graeciae descriptio. 3 vols. leipzig, teubner. 1903. greek text available at the perseus digital library. tzetzes, john, book of histories, book ii-iv translated by gary berkowitz from the original greek of t. kiessling's edition of 1826. online version at theio.com princesses in greek mythology women of heracles\",\n",

primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 107ag, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay. the primary decay products before 107ag are palladium (element 46) isotopes and the primary products after are cadmium (element 48) isotopes. the palladium isotope 107pd decays by beta emission to 107ag with a half-life of 6.5 million years. iron meteorites are the only objects with a high enough palladium/silver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107ag abundance. radiogenic 107ag was first discovered in the santa clara meteorite in 1978. the discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of iron-cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event. 107pd versus 107ag correlations observed in bodies, which have clearly been melted since the accretion of the solar system, must reflect the presence of live short-lived nuclides in the early solar system. list of isotopes |- | rowspan=2 | 92ag | rowspan=2 |

       " 'duncan macgregor crerar (4 december 1836 - 11 march 1916) was a scottish poet who spent much of his adult life in western ontario and new york city, writing sentimental poetry commemorating places and friends in scotland. a native gaelic speaker, he wrote primarily in english, with gaelic phrases and diction. he was referred to by some contemporaries as \"the breadalbane bard\" or \"bard of amulree\". in his book scottish poets in america (new york, ny, 1889), john d. ross described him: in conclusion, we would state that mr. crerar is one of the most genial of men, kind, sympathetic, and generous in all his actions. in his own quiet, unobtrusive way, and unknown to the world, he has rendered assistance to many when they found the clouds of adversity hovering over them: and there are few men similarly circumstance who can boast of so large and so sincere a following of friends. parents crerar was born in amulree, glenquaich, perthshire, scotland, the son of alexander crerar (or mackintosh) (1801 - before 1861), a mason and shepherd, and janet macgregor (1810 - 15 august 1885). his son eulogized him in his poem \"mementoes of my father\\'s grave\", written on 1 november 1878 in new york, and dedicated to duncan\\'s brother alexander m. crerar (born 9 july 1849) (published in the celtic magazine, inverness, january 1883): mementoes of my father\\'s grave soft, silky leaves of freshest green, which grew upon my father\\'s grave; mementoes hallowed of a man whose heart was warm, sincere, and brave. of humble sphere, but noble aims, he calmly stemmed life\\'s stormy sea; upright and manly, frank and pure, a trusty friend, and true was he. a loving husband, faithful, kind; a tender father, wise, discreet; our weal his chief concern, delight, his happy home made labour sweet. his words were few; for well he weighed each thought and subject ere he spoke; in humour rich; and oft essayed a simple, pleasant, harmless joke. my father! thy blest memory i dearly cherish day by day; and for its sake i\\'ll prize these leaves, which grew about thy sacred clay. and when life\\'s course with me is run -- when, soon or late, i must resign this earthly frame-oh, may it rest beneath a turf as green as thine! he eulogized his mother janet in the poem, \"s\\'rioghal ma dhream\" (\"my race is royal\"—motto of clan macgregor), \"in affectionate remembrance of my beloved mother. died at amulree, dunkeld, scotland, august 15, 1885\", written 25 august 1885 in new york city: \"mother is dead!\" heart-rending news to me. dead my belovèd! oh how keen my pain! on earth, alas! we ne\\'er shall meet again: \"mother is dead!\" sent o\\'er the cold, deep sea! \"my race is royal,\" motto of thy line; if royal here, they welcome royal there, where, free from every sorrow, trouble, care, thou dwellest in the light and love divine! to me henceforth this life will lonesome be. deep was thy love, self-sacrificing, kind. now do i feel all that thou wert to me, since thou art gone and i am left behind. in gloomy sadness mourns for thee thy son. father, forgive: thy will, not mine, be done! birth duncan macgregor crerar was born at amulree, glenquaich, perthshire on 4 december 1837 [perth pamphlets, v.18]. he received a good education, studying under robert sinclair, and was destined by his parents to join the presbyterian ministry. he abandoned these intentions, however, on the death of his father. emigration to north america in 1857 he went to canada, where he worked \"in mercantile pursuits\". there he met many former friends from amulree. soon after his arrival, he entered the active militia as a member of company \"a\" of perth, ontario, and served on the frontier during the fenian raids of 1865. john ross states that \"...in recognition of his valuable services, the canadian government, when under the direction of his warm friend, the honourable alexander mackenzie, gazetted him honorary lieutenant of the company with which he served.\" [john ross, scottish poets in america, 37]. it is probable that crerar had known mackenzie, a future canadian prime minister, for a long time, as both came from dunkeld, perthshire. after his military service, crerar wrote for the stratford beacon, in stratford, ontario. he went to toronto and studied for a short session. he then left for new york city, where he furthered his journalistic career. at the time of his marriage in 1869 he was the assistant manager of the scottish american journal of new york. he returned to scotland to wed. on 4 august 1869, he married jessie anderson campbell (born circa 1842 - died before 1916) at the free church manse, of bridge of perth, kilmadock, perth. jessie anderson campbell was the 27-year-old daughter of donald campbell, a hotelkeeper of langton, and mary campbell. crerar resided in new york until around 1905. poems written after 1905 indicate that he returned to scotland to live out his life. he dedicated several of these later poems to citizens of crieff, where he spent his final years. in religion, he was a liberal presbyterian, attending regularly the fifth avenue presbyterian church, led by the reverend dr. hall. in canada he joined the free masons, and was an officeholder in the blue lodge and royal arch. he was also a founding and active member of the burns society of new york city. death crerar died in crieff, perthshire, scotland at age 78. he was found in his bed at home at westview, burrell street at 8:30 in the morning. it was recorded that he was the widower of jessie campbell. his occupation was recorded as poet, and an annuitant of an andrew carnegie trust. his brother donald of aberfoyle reported the death. poetic works crerar is perhaps best remembered for his robert burns, an anniversary poem, (london, m. ward, 1885), which \"... was read before the burns society of new york at the celebration of the 126th anniversary of the birthday of the scottish national bard\": excerpt from \"a poem commemorating robbie burns\" he touched our country\\'s ancient harp with truest patriotic fire; forth thrilling came soul-stirring strains, man\\'s nobler actions to inspire. the cottar\\'s fireside, ‘neath his spell, becomes at once a hallowed shrine; his hymn to mary swells the heart, and fills the eye his auld lang syne. not to his native land alone his genius and his fame belong, in other climes is treasured dear his matchless legacy of song. his melodies have echoing gone to continents and isles afar; they cheer and gladden hearts alike ‘neath southern cross and polar star. in 1890, he published whistle blinkie: a collection of songs for the social circle (glasgow: david robertson & co., 1890). another poem receiving some further reference was \"my bonnie rowan tree\", dedicated to his brother john crerar, and written in new york on september 25, 1876: \"thrice welcome sweet green spray culled from my rowan tree, by loved ones far away, in bonnie amulree. in boyhood\\'s days thy root was planted by my hand; just ere i left my dear, my scottish fatherland. thou but a sapling then, though now a sheltering tree, while warblers in thy boughs, sing sweetest melodies. one boon for which i pray, a home in amulree, where friends of yore i\\'d meet, beneath thee, rowan tree. the freuchie wimpling by, in cadence soft and slow, graig thullich tow\\'ring high, the fragrant woods below. the old kirke on the knowe, the graveyard mossy green, the mossy birks, lubchuil, the streamlet\\'s silvery sheen. with warm breadalbane hearts ‘mong those romantic braes, i happily could spend, the gloaming of my days. the memories of langsyne, bright days of gladsome glee, we fondly could revive, beneath the rowan tree.\" [in history of the pioneers of north easthope; alex. muir mackenzie, taketties & tyres in strathbraan: at 28; the celtic magazine (inverness), nov. 1882)] \"caledonia\\'s bonnie blue bells\", written in new york, september 23, 1881, recounts his visit to his family\\'s now-deserted croft, and discovering his father\\'s bed now exposed to the scottish elements: hail, bonnie blue bells ! ye come hither to me with a brother\\'s warm love from far o\\'er the sea; fair dowerets ! ye grew on a calm, sacred spot -- the ruins alas ! of my kind father\\'s cot caledonia\\'s blue bells, o bonnie blue bells ! what memories dear of that cot ye recall, though now there remains neither rooftree nor wall ! alack a-day ! lintel and threshold are gone, while cold ‘neath the weeds lies the hallowed hearthstone !

caledonia\\'s blue bells, o bonnie blue bells ! our sire long asleep, his fond mem\\'ry endeared; the mother still spared us, beloved and revered; sweet blue bells with charmed recollections entwined of scenes in my childhood forever enshrined. caledonia\\'s blue bells, o bonnie blue bells ! [celtic magazine, february 1882; alex. muir mackenzie, taketties & tyres in strathbraan, at 26] a stanza of caledonia\\'s bonnie blue bells is quoted in william black\\'s 1894 novel stand fast, craig royston. the reciter, george bethune, a \"garrulous\" elderly scotsman expatriate, states of the author: \"that was written by the bard of amulree, your lordship...and a truer scotchman does not breathe, though america has been his home nearly all his life...\" music for crerar\\'s poem \"the eirlic well\" (\"inscribed, with sincere esteem, to the edinburgh breadalbane association, new york, september 1880\") was composed by archibald menzies, s.s.c. edinburgh. the eirlic well pours a rill into girron burn at amulree. girron burn flows into the fraochie (braan), which merges with the tay at the foot of birnam hill, dunkeld.

       " 'alice abigail corkran was an irish author of children\\'s fiction and an editor of children\\'s magazines. born in france to irish parents, she grew up in the stimulating environment of her mother\\'s literary salon. she was a playmate of robert browning\\'s ageing father, and still had his workbooks in her possession when she died. as well as writing a number of well received novels, she edited first the bairn\\'s annual and then the girl\\'s realm, being the founder of that magazine\\'s guild of service and good fellowship, which maintained a cot at the ormond street hospital for sick children, among other charitable works. early life alice corkran was born in paris, france to john frazer corkran (18081884) and louisa walsh (18231892). she was the second oldest of five children: three girls, and two boys. her father began life as a dramatist and had a play, the painter of italy, well received at the theatre royal, dublin on 9 march 1840, but by that time he was already in paris. he was the paris correspondent of the morning herald and the evening standard. john was in paris for all the excitement of the 1848 revolution and he wrote a book: history of the national constituent assembly from may, 1848 (1849) that was said to be still the standard text on the constituent assembly more than 30 years later. louisa corkran married her husband in dublin in june or july 1839. they were soon in paris where their five children were born; the first, henrietta, was born on 21 october 1841. louisa\\'s salon in paris was frequented by m. vigny, and by the whole literary group that acknowledged him as the leader. the poet robert browning was a friend, and his wife travelled twice a year to paris to visit louisa. thackeray, then writing vanity fair, was also a friend of the family and almost acted as a fairy godfather to the children. when the family returned to london, her house in bloomsbury became a rendezvous for many eminent men and women of letters. alice corkran grew up in a stimulating environment. she was the playmate of robert browning\\'s father, and she used to accompany the old man on his rambles along the quays in search of subjects to sketch. she was the old man\\'s favourite. she published some of his sketches to illustrate an article about the brownings in the girl\\'s realm in 1905. she still had his old notebooks with their sketches when she died. corkran was educated at home and studied art in paris until the family had to leave paris following some reverses of fortune. they moved to bloomsbury in london. works longer works corkran\\'s fame rested in particular on her first novel bessie lang as well as her other novel down the snow stairs. these works were cited occasionally to reference the author. both attracted very positive critical attention on first publication. of bessie lang reviewers said: \"so sweet, so simple, and at the same time so strongly descriptive is the style in which this tale is told that it seems to have caught some feature of merit from each part in the telling.\"the examiner \"if miss corkran is a novice in fiction, as her title-page would seem to indicate, she is a writer who may well have a future before her, for the pretty and touching tale she here gives us is told with a simplicity and absence of straining after effect which bespeak a true feeling for her art, whilst the beauty and pathos of many touches in it are unquestionable.\"the graphic \"indeed, so many the principal elements of a high-class work are undoubtedly to be found in \" bessie lang,\" that the authoress may claim to have stepped at once into foremost place amongst contemporary writers of fiction. the reader will probably not have perused many pages without being agreeably reminded of such writings as those of mrs. gaskell, mrs. oliphant, mrs. craik, miss thackeray, whose works edify and interest by their purity and power rather than any perceptible straining after effect.\"birmingham daily gazette down the snow stairs also attracted a favourable critical response: \"it is quite as enthralling as \"alice in wonderland,\" but much more human and real. at the same time, every page is bathed in the golden and undying light of romance, without which a child\\'s story-book is as uninteresting to little folks as an auctioneer\\'s catalogue.\"sheffield independent \"we have rarely read anything better of its kind than \"down the snow stairs\".\"the scotsman \"one of the most charming children\\'s stories imaginable, and will assuredly be very popular\"john bull \"we have to place this book alongside of carrol\\'s alice in wonderland...a better and brighter book we have not read for a long time.\"aberdeen press and journal after 1890, all of corkran\\'s longer works were non-fiction. her non-fiction works were also well received by critics, and one of her obituaries referred to her book on leighton as an excellent critical biography. the source for the following data is the british library catalogue (bl cat.), supplemented and cross-checked against kirk, sutherland, watson, library hub discover, and the circulating library database, supplemented by searches of the used book trade. the year of publication has been corrected from the nominal year, where necessary, by checking for reviews of the books in newspaper archives. legend for the column

margery merton\\'s girlhood is available online at google books, and meg\\'s friend as a gutenberg etext. one work stands out on the list as being very dissimilar from the others, the fatal house. this is a cheaply-priced (one shilling) melodrama completely unlike corkran\\'s other output, and there are no references on the title page to her other works. as noted in the table above, it is available as an online text at the british library. the morning post said of the book: \"miss alice corkran has written a tale sufficiently full of mystery and horror to satisfy the most voracious appetite. \"the fatal house\" exercises a baneful influence on all who reside under its roof. the history of its owners is one of crime, vice, and debauchery ; nothing but evil survives within its sin-tainted walls. such ample evidence of this is adduced, that the unhappy wife of the last owner, in a state bordering on delirium, burns the house and its contents to the ground, thus lifting the curse which she feels has been laid upon it. it is an un- canny story from beginning to end, and its tone is morbid and unpleasant.\" anthologies corkran published three anthologies of her stories: the adventures of mrs. wishing-to-be and other stories (see within longer works above) contained the title story, plus \"willie and mary in search of fairy land\" and \"wish-day\". mischievous jack and other stories contained \"mischievous jack and the old fisherman\" and \"a little king\" which had both appeared in the first volume of the bairn\\'s annual in 1885; and \"boppy\\'s repentance\". the young philistine, and other stories contained the title story, previously published as \"a young philistine\" in merry england in 1885; \"pere perrault\\'s legacy\", which had first appeared as \"how pere perrault spent his legacy\" in belgravia in july 1882; \"a village genius\" first published as \"mademoiselle angele\" in the gentleman\\'s annual for 1881; and the lead story of the collection \"the english teacher at the convent\", which sutherland said was notable among the short stories of corkran, which \"have some charm\". the story is a version of \"miss martha\\'s bag\", which appeared in the first number of merry england. the athenaeum said of this collection that: \"we find in miss corkran\\'s work a delicacy of touch, a fine humour, and a pathos which give to these little stories something of the charm and finish of a miniature.\" the young philistine and other stories is available online at google books. other anthologies that corkran contributed to were: the story \"pea blossom\" in stories jolly: stories new: stories strange & stories true. a series of new and original tales for boys and girls, from six to fourteen years old (1889), edited by h. c. adams, and published in london by skeffington & son \"the adventures of a would-be king of the giants\" in the children\\'s hour. a collection of stories & poems, (1896), edited by may bateman and published in london by simpkin & marshall. this publication was sold in aid of the princess may\\'s invalid children\\'s aid association. an unnamed story in the anthology 52 stories for the little ones (1902), published in london by hutchinson & co. as part of their \"52\" series editing and shorter works corkran edited the bairn\\'s annual from 1885 to 1890 and contributed articles to it at the same time. the 1885 annual is available online at google books. the annual was well received with the freeman\\'s journal saying: \"this is one of the most well-arranged and interesting children\\'s books that we have seen for a long time, containing little stories of almost every class, and an original song with music. there is an etching as a frontispiece entitled \"in disgrace\", which is worth all the money the book costs.\" that front-piece was by william luker jnr. the first issue of the girl\\'s realm was published in 1898 with corkran as both a contributor and editor. the first edition of the magazine, with 140 illustrations, was well reviewed. in the advert for the girl\\'s realm in the london daily news of 26 october 1898, the following reviewer comments about the magazine are quoted: \"far out-distances anything of the kind hitherto offered\"world \"the variety in this number is extraordinary. . . the public reflects great credit on all concerned in its production...\"daily news: \"appears to mix all the desirable ingredients of a girl\\'s reading in happy proportion.\"queen the girl\\'s realm ran for 17 volumes from november 1898 to november 1915. it then seems to have been folded into the woman at home, where corkran was the editor for three years, resigning in early 1902. she remained involved with the magazine, not only as a contributor, but also as the founder and guiding spirit of the guild of service and good fellowship, one of the leading features of the magazine. the guild was founded in april 1900 by corkran and charged a nominal subscription to members. the guild supported a cot at the ormond street hospital for sick children, and also provided a scholarship to the royal college of music. other activities included providing christmas treats, one in bethnal green for 117 children and one in kensal green for 360 children, with the guild members themselves providing the presents. the guild had over 2,300 members by 1905. kirk, who wrote in 1891, reported that corkran \"is now a journalist, contributing to many london papers.\" corkran contributed stories and pieces to a range of publications, including the magazines: the gentleman\\'s annual for 1881 - \"mademoiselle angele\". available at google books. belgravia - \"how pere perrault spent his legacy\". available at google books. merry england - \"miss martha\\'s

girl\\'s realm, corkran was a literary reviewer in the daily news and was also contributing articles to various london papers. later life and death corkran\\'s mother, louisa, died in 1882. she had been in declining health for some time and in her final years she depended largely on her daughter alice\\'s care. corkran\\'s father died in 1884 and her parents are buried together at brompton cemetery. corkran had a health scare in october 1892 when she was run over by a brougham in exhibition road, south kensington, london. her leg was badly injured and she suffered from shock, and recovered only slowly, so that it was the end of the year before she could resume literary work. in 1901, corkran was living in mecklenburgh square with her sister harriet and richard whiteing. she was still living with whiteing (who had separated from his wife) at the time of the 1911 census where she described her position in the house as inmate, which the enumerator corrected to the approved term boarder. both her sisters died in 1911. henrietta, who died on 17 march 1911, had never married. her sister mary had married barclay v. head of the british museum and had one daughter, alice augusta louisa, who was living with her father at the time of the 1911 census (immediately after her mother\\'s death on 30 march 1911). the dates of the deaths of the two brothers is uncertain, but whiteing says that alice was the last remaining survivor of her branch of the family, and one death notice referred to her being the last surviving child of her late father. corkran was plagued by poverty in her later years and also suffered from declining health. she died suddenly, but not unexpectedly, on 2 february 1916. her niece, alice augusta louisa head, was an executrix of her will.

       " 'baby colic, also known as infantile colic, is defined as episodes of crying for more than three hours a day, for more than three days a week, for three weeks in an otherwise healthy child. often crying occurs in the evening. it typically does not result in long-term problems. the crying can result in frustration of the parents, depression following delivery, excess visits to the doctor, and child abuse. the cause of colic is unknown. some believe it is due to gastrointestinal discomfort like intestinal cramping. diagnosis requires ruling out other possible causes. concerning findings include a fever, poor activity, or a swollen abdomen. fewer than 5% of infants with excess crying have an underlying organic disease. treatment is generally conservative, with little to no role for either medications or alternative therapies. extra support for the parents may be useful. tentative evidence supports certain probiotics for the baby and a low-allergen diet by the mother in those who are breastfed. hydrolyzed formula may be useful in those who are bottlefed. colic affects 10-40% of babies. equally common in bottle and breast-fed infants, it begins during the second week of life, peaks at 6 weeks, and resolves between 12 and 16 weeks. it rarely lasts up to one year of age. it occurs at the same rate in boys and in girls. the first detailed medical description of the problem was published in 1954. signs and symptoms colic is defined as episodes of crying for more than three hours a day, for more than three days a week for at least a three-week duration in an otherwise healthy child. it is most common around six weeks of age and gets better by six months of age. by contrast, infants normally cry an average of just over two hours a day, with the duration peaking at six weeks. with colic, periods of crying most commonly happen in the evening and for no obvious reason. associated symptoms may include legs pulled up to the stomach, a flushed face, clenched hands, and a wrinkled brow. the cry is often high pitched (piercing). effect on the family an infant with colic may affect family stability and be a cause of short-term anxiety or depression in the father and mother. it may also contribute to exhaustion and stress in the parents. persistent infant crying has been associated with severe marital discord, postpartum depression, early termination of breastfeeding, frequent visits to doctors, and a quadrupling of excessive laboratory tests and prescription of medication for acid reflux. babies with colic may be exposed to abuse, especially shaken baby syndrome. parent training programs for managing infantile colic may result in a reduction in crying time. causes the cause of colic is generally unknown. fewer than 5% of infants who cry excessively turn out to have an underlying organic disease, such as constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, lactose intolerance, anal fissures, subdural hematomas, or infantile migraine. babies fed cow\\'s milk have been shown to develop antibody responses to the bovine protein, and some studies have shown an association between consumption of cow\\'s milk and infant colic. studies performed showed conflicting evidence about the role of cow\\'s milk allergy. while previously believed to be related to gas pains, this does not appear to be the case. another theory holds that colic is related to hyperperistalsis of the digestive tube (increased level of activity of contraction and relaxation). the evidence that the use of anticholinergic agents improve colic symptoms supports this hypothesis. psychological and social factors have been proposed as a cause, but there is no evidence. studies performed do not support the theory that maternal (or paternal) personality or anxiety causes colic, nor that it is a consequence of a difficult temperament of the baby, but families with colicky children may eventually develop anxiety, fatigue and problems with family functioning as a result. there is some evidence that cigarette smoke may increase the risk. it seems unrelated to breast or bottle feeding with rates similar in both groups. reflux does not appear to be related to colic. diagnosis colic is diagnosed after other potential causes of crying are excluded. this can typically be done via a history and physical exam, and in most cases tests such as x-rays or blood tests are not needed. babies who cry may simply be hungry, uncomfortable, or ill. less than 10% of babies who would meet the definition of colic based on the amount they cry have an identifiable underlying disease. cause for concern include: an elevated temperature, a history of breathing problems or a child who is not appropriately gaining weight. indications that further investigations may be needed include: vomiting (vomit that is green or yellow, bloody or occurring more than five times a day) change in stool (constipation or diarrhea, especially with blood or mucous) abnormal temperature (a rectal temperature less than or over irritability (crying all day with few calm periods in between) lethargy (excess sleepiness, lack of smiles or interested gaze, weak sucking lasting over six hours) poor weight gain (gaining less than 15 grams a day) problems to consider when the above are present include: infections (e.g. ear infection, urine infection, meningitis, appendicitis) intestinal pain (e.g. food allergy, acid reflux, constipation, intestinal blockage) trouble breathing (e.g. from a cold, excessive dust, congenital nasal blockage, oversized tongue) increased brain pressure (e.g. hematoma, hydrocephalus) skin pain (e.g. a loose diaper pin, irritated rash, a hair wrapped around a toe) mouth pain (e.g. yeast infection) kidney pain (e.g. blockage of the urinary system) eye pain (e.g. scratched cornea, glaucoma) overdose (e.g. excessive vitamin d, excessive sodium) others (e.g. migraine headache, heart failure, hyperthyroidism) persistently fussy babies with poor weight gain, vomiting more than five times a day, or other significant feeding problems should be evaluated for other illnesses (e.g. urinary infection, intestinal obstruction, acid reflux). treatment management of colic is generally conservative and involves the reassurance of parents. calming measures may be used and include soothing motions, limiting stimulation, pacifier use, and carrying the baby around in a carrier, although it is not entirely clear if these actions have any effect beyond placebo. swaddling does not appear to help. medication no medications have been found to be both safe and effective. simethicone is safe but does not work, while dicyclomine works but is not safe. evidence does not support the use of cimetropium bromide, and there is little evidence for alternative medications or techniques. while medications to treat reflux are common, there is no evidence that they are useful. diet dietary changes by infants are generally not needed. in mothers who are breastfeeding, a hypoallergenic diet by the mother—not eating milk and dairy products, eggs, wheat, and nuts—may improve matters, while elimination of only cow\\'s milk does not seem to produce any improvement. in formula-fed infants, switching to a soy-based or hydrolyzed protein formula may help. evidence of benefit is greater for hydrolyzed protein formula with the benefit from soy based formula being disputed. both these formulas have greater cost and may not be as palatable. supplementation with fiber has not been shown to have any benefit. a 2018 cochrane review of 15 randomized controlled trials involving 1,121 infants was unable to recommend any dietary interventions. a 2019 review determined that probiotics were no more effective than placebo although a reduction in crying time was measured. complimentary and alternative medicine no clear beneficial effect from spinal manipulation or massage has been shown. further, as there is no evidence of safety for cervical manipulation for baby colic, it is not advised. there is a case of a three-month-old dying following manipulation of the neck area. little clinical evidence supports the efficacy of \"gripe water\" and caution in use is needed, especially in formulations that include alcohol or sugar. evidence does not support lactase supplementation. the use of probiotics, specifically lactobacillus reuteri, decreases crying time at three weeks by 46 minutes in breastfeed babies but has unclear effects in those who are formula fed. fennel also appears effective. prognosis infants who are colicky do just as well as their non colicky peers with respect to temperament at one year of age. epidemiology colic affects 10-40% of children, occurring at the same rate in boys and in girls. history the word \"colic\" is derived from the ancient greek word for intestine (sharing the same root as the word \"colon\"). it has been an age-old practice to drug crying infants. during the second century ad, the greek physician galen prescribed opium to calm fussy babies, and during the middle ages in europe, mothers and wet nurses smeared their nipples with opium lotions before each feeding. alcohol was also commonly given to infants. in past decades, doctors recommended treating colicky babies with sedative medications (e.g. phenobarbital, valium, alcohol), analgesics (e.g. opium) or anti-spasm drugs (e.g. scopolamine, donnatal, dicyclomine), but none of these are now recommended because of potential serious side-effects, including death. references external links

       " 'corrigin is a town in the central wheatbelt region of western australia, east-southeast of the state capital, perth, western australia, along state route 40. it is mostly a farming community focused on crops and sheep, and holds the world record of \"the most dogs in a ute\". history the name \"corrigin\", of noongar aboriginal origin, was first recorded in 1877 relating to a well in the area. the meaning of the name is unknown. before 1908 corrigin\\'s only connection with the rest of the state was the railway track that ran to merredin and it was difficult to get anyone to take up land near the rabbit proof fence. most of the land was once held by george walton on a pastoral lease, which he ran from his homestead at wogerlin rock. the first settlers to the area were mr a. w. goyder (the son of the south australian surveyor general), who took up the area on which the town now stands. he was followed by jack crossland then by messrs gayfer and jose bros. in 1909, the government planned to build a railway from brookton on the great southern railway to the town of kunjin, 17 km west of corrigin. some time after, a line from wickepin was also proposed, and the government decided to locate the crossing point at corrigin. a storm swept through the area in 1913 lashing the area with hailstones over in diameter. the town was also deluged with over of rain in a few hours. standing crops were flattened, fences in low-lying areas were washed away and most of the town was submerged under at least of water. in 1913, a railway siding was built, and named \"dondakin\" by railway authorities due to conflict with the name elsewhere. however, after much local protest, the siding was renamed corrigin and gazetted on 15 may 1914. the railway line from wickepin, western australia opened a month later, and the main office of the local road board moved to the town. in 1915, a school was built. in 1932 the wheat pool of western australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. the bulk handling facility had been installed by november the following year and the first trial load of wheat was satisfactorily loaded. by 1937 the town boasted a hall that cost £8,000 to build, a large state hotel, commercial buildings, bowling green, tennis course, golf course and one of the best showgrounds in the state. the town still had no adequate water scheme, there was no lack of well water but the water drawn was very hard. the wheatbelt was struck by drought for much of 1939 and nearly all of 1940, described at the time as \"the worst in the states history\" until heavy rains arrived in december of that year. corrigin received of drought-breaking rain over a couple of days. the town was lashed by a violent storm on new year\\'s day in 2013. destructive winds and of rain tore through over the course of an hour leaving behind fallen powerlines, uprooted trees, sheds torn apart and roofs ripped from homes. present day corrigin has a population of 903 and is a key agricultural centre for a district focused mainly on wheat and sheep farming. it is the location of a cbh management zone office, and in 1973 was the location of a \"type b\" wheat bin. it contains a district high school (originally opened 1915 as a primary school), national australia bank branch, shopping facilities, accommodation (hotel, motel, caravan park), council offices and a telecentre. each year, it hosts an agricultural show. the town is a stop on the transwa bus service to esperance via kulin/hyden. a large rocky outcrop just to the east of town is corrigin rock. about 5 km west of town is the corrigin dog cemetery, containing over 80 buried dogs. in popular culture corrigan, the fictional town in which the 2009 craig silvey novel jasper jones and the subsequent film are set, derives its name from corrigin. climate references external links shire of corrigin dog in a ute - includes photos and history of the event. corrigin dog cemetery towns in western australia wheatbelt (western australia) grain receival points of western australia',\n",

       " 'according to a \"global driver satisfaction\" survey conducted by the navigation app waze in 2015, metro manila had the \"worst traffic on southeast asia\". emerson carlos, mmda assistant general manager for operation has mentioned that in 2015, motor vehicle registrations in metro manila peaked at around 2.5 million. causes infrastructure problems one of the primary causes of traffic density within metro manila is the current transportation infrastructure. overall, there is a lack of quality infrastructure thus insufficient modes of mobility. the duterte administration has promised that the coming years will be the, \"golden age of infrastructure\", with a record $168 billion to be spent on 5,000 projects across the nation\". road network the road network of metro manila consists of radial (r-1 to r-10) and circumferential (c-1 to c-5) roads. these are the principal arteries within the city, however given the density of vehicles within the metropolis the roads have become inadequate. \"metro manila only has 1 km of road per 424 vehicles.\" furthermore, the roads are of poor quality and do not receive maintenance. for example, in the scope of the entire country, \"of the 31,400 km of national roads in the system, only about 45% (14,200 km) were assessed as being in good or fair condition in november 2011.\" the railway system the current railways carry around 1.3 million passengers per day and spans in 4 different lines. in 1998, plans for a railway expansion were implemented however only of the planned was actually built. as such, there exists a lack of an adequate non-road-based public transportation system. this is made evident with the problem of overcrowding during peak hours, which is at 4:00pm to 5:00 pm. road-based public transport in metro manila, a variety of road-based public transport, such as tricycles, taxis, buses, and jeepneys which are all privately owned \"account for more than 50% of daily commuting trips, incur no subsidy, and with low productivity.\" meanwhile, \"car travel accounts for 30% of person-km, but constitutes 72% of the road traffic in terms of pcu-km.\" the high number of vehicles on the road, which could be attributed to the high population, is one of the contributors to traffic congestion. urban planning problems according to renowned urban planner felino palafox jr., metro manila used to be an example of good urban planning until the mid-1970s. palafox cited gated communities within central business districts, and the decision of local government units within the metropolitan area to \"throw away\" the metro manila zoning ordinance in the 1990s, as contributors to metro manila\\'s urban planning \"mess\". urban area expansion the urban area of metro manila experiences a high growth rate in population, reaching a rate of . within the period of 2000-2001, the city experienced a rate of 1.8%, resulting from the spillover of people from nearby towns, cities, and provinces. the urban planning of the city is not adequate vis a vis the high population density. statistics show that the city must \"accommodate about an additional two million to six million by 2030.\" traffic congestion \"today, traffic demand is at 12.8 million trips in metro manila. most of these trips are made using the public transport owing to its 69% share of total trips. the lesser share of the trips is done by private mode and yet it is this mode that takes up 78% of road space.\" at the current state, the traffic volume within the metropolis already exceeds the capacities of existing roads. economic theories the roadmap for transport infrastructure for metro manila and its surrounding areas (region iii & region iv-a) study by the japan international cooperation agency (jica) in response to the national economic development (neda) request for assistance in creating a guide for transport development in metro manila, the two regions of central luzon and calabarzon. the guide was made to help neda deliberate on the contents of a short-term (2014 - 2016) and a medium term (2017 - 2022) transport investment program (trip). for the short-term transport investment program (trip), it takes the goals of the philippine development plan for 2011 to 2016 and makes it into projects in the transport sector. it has invested as much as 5% of the gdp in infrastructure as one of the five key strategies to achieving the trip. a huge difference from the previous investing rate, which was as low as 2% of the gdp. same study has also found that during their research period, the metro manila traffic was costing the city and the people php 2.4 billion per day in the year 2012. and, if no measures are undertaken, this transport cost can rise up to php 6.0 billion per day in 2030. this is will be worst-case scenario in the increase of transport costs in metro manila and the areas of bulacan, rizal, laguna, and cavite if there will be no improvements done on the transport infrastructure of these areas and the philippines overall. high population in busina: current state, alternatives and emerging filipino values on metro manila traffic, metro manila is classified as a global power city. this is because of majority of the industries present in the philippines have located their offices in the national capital region (ncr). the city is also where all the foreign consulates and embassies are situated. this makes ncr the home of finance and commerce, hence the allure of in-migration from filipinos from the provinces. although this is not the main cause of road traffic in the city, the influx of people adds to it. yves boquet, in his paper battling congestion in manila: the edsa problem, quotes robert cervero in saying globalization, outsourcing and relocating much of the manufacturing activities are just some of the other causes that add to the high population in metro manila. these activities are mainly responsible for the influx that was previously mentioned. these activities are creating the job that appeal to people in the province to make the move. growing car ownership another cause of heavy traffic in the cities is the increase of the purchasing power of most people in metro manila. according to euromonitor\\'s consumer lifestyles in the philippines (2015), young professionals in the metro tend to buy small cars such as toyota wigo, mitsubishi mirage, and honda jazz that adds to road congestion. this is due to the affordability of the said cars, which gives them reason not to use public transport. referring back to the study that dubs edsa as the main passageway of the greater manila area, the city accounts for 35.7% of the philippines\\' economic output, 18% of its population and 28% of its motor vehicles. all of which are accommodated on barely 0.2% of the country\\'s land area. according to the study of mmda, in edsa alone, there are 247,527 private 4-wheel vehicles that ply every day. it has the highest number compared to motorcycles, taxi, bus, and trucks. public transportation system the main modes of public transport in the philippines are jeepneys, buses, taxis, trains and tricycles, all of which are readily available in metro manila. the introduction of transportation apps grab and uber came in 2013 and 2014, respectively, further widening the options of public transport. the philippine traffic was considered the world\\'s 9th worst in 2015 by numbeo despite this range of public transport options. although there is a wide array of choices, the public still spend an average of 45.5 minutes before reaching their workplace. this is why most filipinos still find travelling via public transport inconvenient due to the high vehicle density and the unavoidable traffic congestion, according to euromonitor\\'s consumer lifestyles in the philippines (2015). road accidents according to metro manila accident reporting and analysis system (mmaras) data from 2008 to 2011 and a study of the severity of road crashes in metro manila, accidents that involved heavy and multiple vehicles, and an elderly pedestrian (60 years old and above), as well as those that occurred during the evening (7 pm to midnight) and late at night (1 am to 5 am) had significantly higher odds of resulting in a fatal outcome. but when the crash involves a female pedestrian and when the road surface is wet the odds of a fatal outcome are lower. the study found that most accidents involving pedestrians happen on high-speed, high-traffic-volume, multilane roadways, that are surrounded by land uses that generate a mix of heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic. it was also found that fatal crashes involving pedestrian happen close to different types of transit stations. effects societal the congestion of vehicles on the road is not entirely unhealthy for the society. in a more specific viewpoint, the congestion between vehicles within a particular region, allows the circulation of other vehicles. congestion occurs inevitably in highly urbanized sectors where the ratio between the population of people and the given area is not proportional and when the demand is high. in some cases, it is even desirable up to a certain point since getting rid of it imposes higher costs than allowing it to persist. the main social effects that occur due to the congestion of vehicles are namely: wasting of time (non-productivity; opportunity cost), delays, frustrated drivers/motorists/passengers, encouraging road rage. economic congestion on the road, from an economic viewpoint suggests that higher levels of congestion are related to faster economic growth. however, above a certain limit, congestion starts to become a detriment to economic growth and the overall welfare of society, rather than an asset. this is due to the cost of the alleviation of congestion in some cities would be higher than the cost of congestion itself. loss of revenue for public transport public transport, trucks and other services are also affected by the traffic in metro manila. instead of being able to do three or four round trips, they usually end up doing less; which means a significant loss in revenues, and ultimately leading to a failing business. public transportation also suffers in that the available schedules become less frequent and the time spent waiting is longer. environmental effects traffic congestion has massive effects on the environment, specifically its contribution to air pollution. air pollution has affected the lives of a number of filipinos. the who said that air pollution is killing millions worldwide, including those in developing countries like the philippines. the metropolitan manila development authority (mmda) noted that dirty air threatens the lives of 12 million residents. the effects of pollutants found in vehicle exhaust include the following: high levels of nitrogen oxide are toxic to humans sulfur dioxide is the primary cause of acid rain carbon dioxide contributes to climate change by insulating more heat from the sun ozone can impair lung function according to the national emissions inventory, last 2012, 71% of the air pollution in the philippines comes from vehicles on the road. the situation is much worse in the national capital region (ncr), wherein 85% of the air pollution comes from vehicles. also, based on data gathered from the department of environment and natural resources, metro manila\\'s air quality situation has worsened in terms of total suspended particulates. there was a rise from 106 µg/ncm in july to december 2014 to 130 µg/ncm in january to april 2015, which are both above the maximum safe level of 90 µg/ncm. the more cars there are on the road, the more pollution is emitted into the air. this is because motor vehicles are one of the main sources of pollution in the world. on the other hand, there is an inverse relationship between the moving speed of traffic and air pollution. the slower the traffic moves, the more pollution is emitted into the air. this is due to the fact that cars burn the most fuel when accelerating to get up to speed. more gas is used up whenever there is an on and off pressing on the gas and break pedals during traffic jams. there have been efforts to lessen the number of vehicles on the road and the production of fuel-efficient green cars with reduced emissions, but air pollution remains to be a problem. the guardian said that \"despite all the promises of green growth and reduced emissions, traditional car sales are accelerating, while efforts to shift towards ‘greener\\' hybrid and electric vehicles are stuck in neutral, particularly in the place where it matters most.\" countermeasures department of transportation in august of 2016, the department of transportation (dotr) has moved towards a more integrated approach to managing traffic on metro manila\\'s roads. the department divided the metropolis into 10 traffic sectors so as to be able to share assets among other government agencies involved in traffic management such as the metropolitan manila development authority (mmda), the highway patrol group of the philippine national police (hpg-pnp), the land transportation office (lto) and the land transportation franchising regulatory board (ltfrb). according to the dotr, by combining forces and coming up with a single chain of command, the agencies will be able to collaborate for better traffic monitoring, uniform implementation of penalties and joint training for traffic personnel. metropolitan manila development authority (mmda) the metropolitan manila development authority\\'s (mmda) services include urban development planning, solid waste disposal, flood control and sewerage management, urban, renewal and zoning, health and sanitation, urban protection, pollution control, public safety during calamities and/or disasters and transport and traffic management; the latter acting as the mmda\\'s most visible function. the unified vehicular volume reduction program (uvvrp) the unified vehicular volume reduction program (uvvrp) is what is more commonly referred to as the \"color coding\" or \"number coding\" system implemented by the mmda. it is a travel demand management program meant to ration road space based on the license plates of vehicles; by regulating the number of vehicles using the roads, the program thereby reduces volume and eases traffic congestion. the scheme was intended to be a temporary solution of the traffic congestion caused by infrastructure projects in the 1990s. it is still being used and remains to be one of the mmda\\'s most well-known traffic initiatives. the first version of the uvvrp was implemented in 1995. during the 1990s, there were many road and railway infrastructure projects being built throughout metro manila; in order to address the resulting increase in congestion, the mmda issued regulation no. 95-001 or the \"odd-even scheme.\" the scheme banned private vehicles with less than three passengers from passing restricted roads during am and pm peak periods on particular days. vehicles in use for public transportation, emergencies, police and military, school buses, diplomatic matters and official media were exempted from this regulation. on tuesdays, thursdays and saturdays, vehicles with license plates that ended in odd numbers were restricted from use; while those that ended in even numbers were restricted from use on mondays, wednesday and fridays. the peak periods during which the vehicles were banned were defined to be from 7:00-9:00 am and 5:00-7:00pm. per violation, there was a p300 penalty charged to offenders. regulation 96—or the \"modified odd-even scheme\"—was then issued in 1996. this scheme applied to public utility vehicles such as taxis, buses, public utility jeepneys, etc., which are banned from all streets of metro manila on particular days of the week from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm based on the plate number ending of each vehicle, as follows: 1 and 2 on mondays, 3 and 4 on tuesdays, 5 and 6 on 7 wednesdays, 7 and 8 on thursdays, 9 and 0 on fridays. this regulation took effect february 19, 1996 and covered all roads in metropolitan manila. 1996 was also the year the mmda, adopted regulation 96-005 entitled the \"unified vehicular volume reduction program\" as a replacement of regulations nos. 95-001 and 96-004. this program aimed to regulate the operation of certain motor vehicles on all national, city and municipal roads in metropolitan manila. under this scheme, private vehicles are banned for longer hours (i.e., between 7:00 am and 7:00 pm). in 2003, the uvvrp was modified to allow for a window time between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm, which was considered to be the off-peak period within the day when restricted vehicles could travel along the specified roads. this scheme, however, was not uniformly adopted in all cities and municipalities throughout metropolis due to differing traffic conditions. in 2010, the uvvrp included both public transportation and private vehicles under the scheme. today, the provision of the uvvrp are as follows: vehicles cannot drive around metro manila based on the last digit of the license plate. 1 and 2 are banned on mondays, 3 and 4 on tuesdays, 5 and 6 on wednesdays 7 and 8 on thursdays and 9 and 0 on fridays. the period of the uvvrp is from 7 am to 8 pm without window hours and it applies to national, circumferential and radial roads in the metropolis. the plate numbers restrained from driving within metro manila are summarized into this table: truck ban ordinance the truck ban is a scheme meant to address the perception that freight vehicles are the main culprits in congesting metro manila roads. under this scheme, trucks are prohibited from traveling along major road networks for most of the day, depending on the type and weight of truck. it has been in place since 1978 and restrains large trucks to designated routes in order to give way to other road users. infractions of the ban carry a fine of p2000. for trucks weighing more than , the truck ban is implemented accordingly: from 6:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. and from 5:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m. every day except sundays and holidays, no cargo truck shall be allowed to travel or pass along: españa boulevard through quezon avenue from echague street to the intersection of west and timog avenues; claro m. recto avenue from legarda street to del pan street; quirino avenue from

saturday, cargo trucks are prohibited from passing these certain roads edsa southbound shaw boulevard (from mandaluyong and pasig) from 5 pm to 10 pm, monday through saturday, cargo trucks are prohibited from passing these certain roads edsa northbound entire stretch of shaw boulevard the ban was first applied in 1978 in recognition of the critical state of traffic congestion being experienced in metro manila through the ordinance no.78-04. this act prohibited cargo trucks with a gross vehicular weight of over from driving along eleven major roads in metro manila during peak traffic hours (6:00 am - 9:00 am, and 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm) daily except on weekends. the department of transportation and communication issued memorandum circulars no. 90-367 in 1990 which repealed the previous truck ban schedule and changed it to the following: 7:00 am - 10:00 am on weekdays 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm monday-thursday 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm on fridays in 1991, in response to the appeal for an alternate route and reduction of the truck ban, the mmda issues ordinance no. 19, amending the original ordinance no. 78-04. this provided alternate routes to those included in the truck ban and allowed a 2-hour reduction of the truck ban period resulting in these effects: 7:00 am - 9:00 am on weekdays 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm monday-thursday 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm on fridays this was further amended when ordinance no. 5 series of 1994 was issued. as a result, trucks were banned from the major arterial road epifanio delos santos avenue. this was an \"all-day\" ban that lasted from 6:00 am - 9:00 pm and was implemented monday through friday. it also restricted trucks from passing along 10 major routes between these particular hours: • 6:00 am - 9:00 am (daily with the exception of saturdays, sundays and holidays) • 5:00 pm - 9:00 pm (daily with the exception of saturdays, sundays and holidays) since then, the mmda has issued regulation no. 96-008 in 1996 thus extending truck ban to saturdays; leaving only sundays and holidays as the exception. this was done in desire to further reduce traffic congestion experienced throughout the week. the gross capacity weight of trucks was also changed from to by the issuance of regulation no. 99-002. u-turn scheme the u-turn scheme was implemented by the mmda in 2002 primarily to account for roundabout operations on the road. this entailed the creation of median opens along busy arterial roads and was composed of two originally separate schemes: the \"big rotunda scheme\" and the \"clearway scheme\". big rotunda scheme construction of median opening pairs closing intersection by use of temporary barriers clearway scheme promote uninterrupted flow along arterial roads meant to speed up congestion along clogged roads essentially, the scheme resulted in the closing of many road intersections as well as the suspension of traffic signal operations in order to allow for the system of median openings. the set up of the u-turn scheme caused lanes of vehicles approaching an intersection to converge and thus be diverted into a single stream towards the u-turn. the u-turn scheme was first applied along commonwealth avenue in quezon city and marikina-infanta highway in pasig and marikina. later on, the scheme was also implemented in other areas on metro manila including various intersections along edsa. social media platforms since 2010, the mmda has tapped into the use of social media such as twitter, in an effort to alleviate the traffic situation. through such platforms, the mmda is able to broadcast live updates to their followers, send out and respond to tweets 24 hours a day. the twitter feed is mostly used to relay information regarding traffic, accidents and number coding (uvvrp) updates. mobile application: mmda traffic navigator the mmda traffic navigator was a mobile application launched in 2011 for android and ios meant to give users quick access to traffic situations surrounding the metro manila\\'s major routes. it delivers real-time traffic updates in specific roads and highways by relying on cctvs to assess the congestion in particular areas. in areas where there are no available cctvs, reports are instead collected from traffic enforces. the application may be accessed via system view or line view; and provides indicators as to whether the current traffic is considered light, moderate or heavy. see also traffic congestion transportation in metro manila transportation in the philippines public utility vehicle modernization program references transportation

       " \"a dive briefing or pre-dive briefing is a meeting of the diving team or dive group before the dive to allow the supervisor, dive leader or dive boat skipper to inform the attendees of the dive plan, contingency plans and emergency plans for the dive. the amount of detail presented should be appropriate to the dive, but there are several topics which are considered standard components of a dive briefing. the topics may vary depending on context. on some occasions an expert or specialist may present part of the dive briefing, particularly aspects relating to specialised tasks, or vessel safety and procedures, but the overall responsibility is with the person responsible for the safety of the group. purpose each member of the dive team needs to understand the objectives of the dive, and their and the other members of the dive team's roles in the dive. the dive briefing allows exchange of this information. a competent professional diver already knows how to dive and carry out the routine and standard emergency diving procedures for the equipment and conditions in which they been trained. the divers may not be familiar with the dive site environmental details or the dive boat in use, or specific details of the objective of the dive, and the specific contingency and emergency response plans for the dive, so the briefing is an opportunity to inform them of relevant information they may not already know which might affect their safety and successful completion of the objectives of the dive. the briefing usually ends by soliciting questions to ensure understanding of task and assignments, and clarification of any uncertainty. recreational divers may not be familiar with each other, or with local procedural details, such as the method of keeping track of who is in the water or back on the boat, buddy separation procedures, conditions for terminating the dive, recall signals, where to sit, water entry and exit procedures specific to the boat or site, how to stow their gear, and where the on-board safety equipment is kept, so this information forms part of the briefing, along with a description of the dive site, known local hazards, local rules and regulations, environmental concerns and the planned route if the dive is to be guided. in some cases allocation of buddy pairs is included in the briefing. audience the dive briefing targets all personnel involved with the safety of the dive and particularly the divers. topics as a general rule the topics of a dive briefing are those things the team members need to know to carry out the planned dive safely and effectively, at the specific site, using the equipment provided, in the conditions as they appear to be on the day of the dive. it is not a necessary part of a dive briefing to inform the team of things that they are expected to know already as competent and qualified divers. a dive briefing for a training dive may include more skill, background and review information, but the briefing should be restricted to information that is likely to be necessary or useful on that specific dive. additional information can be counterproductive if it distracts attention from the core material, or reduces the likelihood of the important information being remembered and used correctly during the diving operation. scientific diving example: standard topics: objectives of the dive responsibilities of the dive team members - for a professional diving team this generally means their job designation for the dive review of specific underwater tasks for the dive planned dive profile - maximum depths and bottom times for the dive geographical extent and features of the dive site review of communications: hand or line signals relevant to the planned dive and foreseeable contingencies. the presence and location of emergency equipment diver recall signals available and the procedures to be followed. buddy separation procedures contingency plans in case conditions become unfavourable any known hazards specific to the dive site significant risks and safety issues identified in the risk assessment other topics that may be relevant in some cases: planned and alternative methods of entry and exit into the water use of emergency signalling equipment use of special tools or equipment lost diver and diver rescue procedures appropriate for the site and dive plan procedures for reducing the risk of developing decompression illness. the padi checklist for dive briefings for recreational diving lists 10 points: the name of the dive site a description of the dive site. this should cover the layout and topography, points of interest and how to navigate between them, hazards specific to the site, sea conditions, general and maximum depth. the role of the divemaster in the planned dive. how the divers can recognize the dive leader underwater, where the divemaster will be relative to the group during the dive and also what they will do to attract attention. entry and exit techniques to be used for the dive the planned procedures for the dive. this includes the suggested course, avoiding problems that may be caused by site hazards and sea conditions, recommendations for safety stops and air reserves, and the planned control of the group. emergency procedures, which should include local protocols, buddy and group separation, low on air and out of air procedures, diver recall and surface signaling devices. review of signals, in case some of the divers do not know the standard signals, and to inform them of local variations. roster and buddy check. orientation on the local environment. this includes informing the divers about the importance of not touching corals and other marine life and to be aware of their proximity to fragile organisms and their buoyancy and trim. pre-dive safety check some of these cover things every trained diver should know, but experience has shown that entry level divers who only dive a few times a year tend to lose their knowledge and skills due to lack of practice, and need to be reminded. legal status a dive briefing may be required in terms of statutory law, regulation, code of practice or organisational operations manual, for diving where there is a duty of care to employees or customers, or it may be merely recommended. in jurisdictions where recreational diving is unregulated, private recreational divers are generally not required to conduct or attend a briefing when they are diving solo or in independent buddy pairs and taking responsibility for their own safety and dive planning. clubs will often provide a briefing for groups on club outings by an experienced diver who knows the area relatively well. references underwater diving procedures underwater diving safety\",\n",

most of the story centres on the debate and dialogue, rather than an expected logical ending, it is likely that many regular cine goers will go home dissatisfied. but for those who appreciate truth, facts of life and intelligent conversations, this is a film smartly interspersed with action and village politics for today\\'s youth\". hemanth kumar of the times of india rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote \"every once in a while there comes a film, which stands apart from the rest in terms of the subject it explores and the tone of narrative, although the nuances might not be blatant. you know it\\'s different because it tries to break free from the template of an action comedy, a genre that has become synonymous with telugu cinema these days. mukunda is exactly that kind of film and much more. it\\'s a film which is so aware of the milieu that it\\'s exploring that you get sucked into the narrative to have a ringside look at the complex characters that inhabit the canvas the story unfolds on.\" suresh kavirayani of deccan chronicle rated the film 3 out of 5 and stated \"finally it\\'s not a regular commercial film, a typical srikanth addala kind of film, without the double meaning dialogues and vulgarity\". in contrast, indiaglitz wrote \"sans loudness and crassness, mukunda has a scent of svsc. but it lacks a good story and barring less than four scenes, it hardly has anything to keep up our interest\" and rated the film 2.75 out of 5. accolades references external links indian drama films films shot in hyderabad, india films directed by srikanth addala

[they] say man until you come back, completely black, go back where you came from too\". music reviews attributed the uneasy community connection expressed in the song to 1960s-1970s african-americans\\' objection to hendrix\\'s \"colorblind vision\" by accusing hendrix of \"achieving stardom by pandering to rock\\'s largely white audience\". the song also makes reference to hendrix\\'s 1968 song \"room full of mirrors\", which refers to a cracked mirror metaphor hendrix used to convey the many sides of his emotions. hendrix estate after hendrix died without a will in 1970, his father al received the rights to hendrix\\'s estate, including \"it\\'s too bad\". a little more than thirty years after the song was recorded, it was one of four hendrix songs newly discovered and added to the jimi hendrix experience, a four disc box set. in reviewing the song on the jimi hendrix experience (2000), producer and audio engineer eddie kramer noted about the tune: \"i think it\\'s very clever, and very, very emotionally charged. it has a tremendous wallop\". two years later, hendrix\\'s father died and leon sued their father\\'s estate and hendrix\\'s stepsister janie to gain control over about one quarter of us$80 million. after washington superior court judge jeffrey m. ramsdell limited leon\\'s claim to a single gold record left to him when his father died in 2002, janie remarked in 2004 about the lawsuit: \"jimi wrote a song about leon and it was called, \\'it\\'s too bad\\'. the lyrics to that song are what this is all about\". references external links lyrics of \"it\\'s too bad\" at sheet music first page for \"it\\'s too bad\" at 1969 songs songs written by jimi hendrix jimi hendrix songs',\n",
       " 'a phantom contour is a type of illusory contour. most illusory contours are seen in still images, such as the kanizsa triangle and the ehrenstein illusion. a phantom contour, however, is perceived in the presence of moving or flickering images with contrast reversal. the rapid, continuous alternation between opposing, but correlated, adjacent images creates the perception of a contour that is not physically present in the still images. quaid et al. have also authored a phd thesis on the phantom contour illusion and its spatiotemporal limits (university of waterloo) which maps out limits and proposes mechanisms for its perception centering around magnocellularly driven visual area mt (see also quaid et al., 2005 on www.pubmed.com). example one example of this illusion involves stimuli consisting of two similar frames, with uniform grey backgrounds: in one frame, the top half contains white dots and the bottom half contains black dots. a second frame contains the reverse of the first frame, in which the white dots of the first frame are replaced with black dots and the black dots are replaced with white dots. the rapid alternation between these two frames reverses the polarity of the dots, while keeping their positions static. at high temporal frequencies (20 hz), the alternating frames are perceived as one non-flickering image, where the individual dots are no longer visible, while simultaneously creating the illusion of a distinct border, dividing the top and bottom halves of the display. this perceived border is a phantom contour illusion. history perceived borders similar to the phantom contour, observed via luminance contrasts, were reported in 1987, when livingstone and hubel analyzed various aspects of vision, and linked them to the magno- and parvocellular subsystems. vilayanur s. ramachandran and d.s. rogers-ramachandran\\'s subsequent research, however, helped pare down and solidify the concept of phantom contours. their research was also the first use of \"texture borders\" to induce this illusion. ramachandran and rogers-ramachandran\\'s research has since led to several more papers on the topic, with varying conclusions regarding the underlying mechanisms responsible for these illusions, as well as considerations for this illusion\\'s potential link to dyslexia. see theories of dyslexia. magnocellular pathway one theory suggests that temporal-frequency processing in the magnocellular pathway, an anatomical pathway that originates in the retina, goes through the lateral geniculate nucleus, and ends in the primary visual cortex, may be connected to the appearance of this illusion (skottun and skoyles debated this link in 2006). the magnocellular pathway is contrast-sensitive, sensitive to motion, and also sensitive to flashing black-to-white edges. livingstone and hubel looked at lateral geniculate cells in both the magno- and parvocellular layers, and found responses to luminance contrasts to be much stronger in magnocellular cells. these cells also had better spatial and temporal resolution. additionally, the magnocelluar pathway is activated more by peripheral vision, in contrast to the parvocelluar pathway, which is activated more by central vision. rogers-ramachandran and ramachandran tested whether or not this preference for peripheral stimuli in the magnocellular cells would have an effect on phantom contour perception. as was predicted, sparsely spaced objects, which degrade the perception of the contours in central vision, were more easily perceived when subjects adjusted their fixation from 0 to 5 degrees eccentricity. this supports the idea that magnocellular cells are responsible for phantom contour perception under such conditions. clinical use ramachandran and rogers-ramachandran proposed that the phantom contour illusion could be used to test whether or not a person\\'s magnocellular pathway is functioning properly, as well as provide a means for analyzing the role and function of the magnocellular system in general. loss of magnocellular function can be found in the early stages of glaucoma. insight into the connection between this illusion and temporal-frequency processing could help us understand underlying mechanisms responsible for certain types of dyslexia (learning impairments in one\\'s reading ability). deficits in rapid visual processing have been seen in dyslexics and are believed to be linked to deficits in the magnocellular pathway. differential sensitivities to temporal-frequency processing may play a role in both the perception of phantom contours, as well as certain reading impairments. sperling et al. found that children with phonological dyslexia (a deficit related to coding meaning of soundsystems of language) showed a decreased ability in perceiving phantom contours, and thus, may be experiencing a magnocellular deficit. additionally, based on rigorous testing of the dyslexics\\' reading abilities, which were compared to their inability to process phantom contours, they found a negative correlation between this magnocellular deficit and reading ability, suggesting a link between magnocellular deficits and orthographic processing (storing patterns of letters in the visual processing system). this is consistent with the theory that some dyslexic people may have motion perception deficits. the pan-sensory deficit hypothesis with regard to dyslexics, states that a deficit in processing rapidly changing stimuli may be a congenital deficit in magnocellular or magnocellular-like processing. variations achromatic vs. chromatic images children with dyslexia possess a lower flicker frequency threshold compared to non-dyslexics when the phantom contour images are achromatic (lacking in color). however, when presented with similar images to the black and white dot images mentioned above, but using equiluminant (aka isoluminant) color, in which the luminance of the colors is the same but the hue is not, the illusion disappears for non-dyslexics as well. adding a luminance difference as small as 10% between the colors, however, re-activates the illusion. this finding suggests that the parvocelluar pathway, which is sensitive to color, is not responsible for this illusion. the magnocelluar pathway, in contrast, is believed to be insensitive to color. ramachandran and rogers-ramachandran compared using equiluminance contours on these tasks to using a psychophysical \"scalpel\" to separate the visual pathway subsystems based on their functional roles. spatial vs. temporal frequency when the stimuli used to present phantom contours consist of adjacent dark and light achromatic horizontal stripes (squarewave gratings), variations in spatial and temporal frequency can be examined. an increase or decrease in stripe thickness adjusts spatial frequency, and temporal frequency is manipulated by increases and decreases in flicker rate. findings show that as spatial frequency is increased, sensitivity to temporal frequency decreases. for example, with a temporal frequency of 7 hz, the spatial frequency required in order for subjects to perceive the phantom contour was 8.96 cycles degree −1. subjects lost the ability to detect temporal phase when temporal frequency was above 7 hz, indicating they relied on some other cue to detect phantom contours. this finding suggests that where phantom contours are processed along the visual system may change, depending on which pattern-detection technique is being utilized. keily et al. looked at stimulus duration, with relation to presentation of flickering images, and found no detection improvement between 34 and 340 milliseconds, suggesting that the first couple of flicker frames are crucial to phantom contour perception. stimulus size and number when analyzing flicker-generated forms, quaid and flanagan noted that, as stimulus size increased, phase-contrast thresholds for these phantom contours decreased. additionally, thresholds decreased as the number of observed stimuli increased. large sized stimuli paired with a large number of stimuli produced the lowest thresholds of all. phantom objects the perception of phantom contours extends beyond just a straight border between two halves of a frame. researchers have employed shapes and alphabetical letters to represent this illusion as well. the presentation is similar to a pseudoisochromatic plate (namely an ishihara plate), but instead of detecting color blindness, this test is intended to detect magnocellular pathway deficits. the contrast reversal at high temporal frequencies eliminates the dot patterns making up the object and the background, thus leaving only the perception of the object border to define the object. as with phantom border tasks, longer exposure times to the flickering images show no enhancement of the illusion, once again indicating that very few frame flickers are needed in order for the illusion to be present. longer ramp durations (onset and offset times of the stimulus presentation), however, drastically increase thresholds for contour illusion detection and eventually eliminate the perceived illusion completely. also consistent with the border tasks, converting the images into equiluminant colors eliminates the illusion of these object borders. controversy there is debate as to whether or not flicker rate is the defining characteristic dividing the phantom contours of the magnocellular pathway and the \"surface characteristics\" of the parvocellular pathway. surface characteristics are defined as the perception of the absolute temporal phase of the flickering images, which becomes apparent at lower frequencies (5-7 hz). in other words, surface characteristics are visible when we are able to see the images flickering from one to the other. this perception occurs at lower flicker rates. at high flicker rates, the images appear as one image. skottun and skoyles found several potential holes in the theory that the percept of phantom contours represents magnocellular activity, and the percept of surface characteristics represents parvocellular activity. one argument is that the high temporal frequencies used to activate the phantom contour illusion (>15 hz) are not optimal frequencies for magnocellular neurons. optimal frequencies for both magno- and parvocellular neurons are similar to each other and are closer to the range of 5-7 hz, the frequency range where surface characteristics can be seen. additionally, they claim that, due to a phase-locking response of parvocellular neurons at high temporal frequencies, there are likely other mechanisms at play when perceiving surface characteristics at these higher temporal frequencies. skottun and skoyles also question whether the perception of phantom contours is specifically related to luminance. our inability to process color at high temporal frequencies may be more related to how the parvocellular system functions, rather than being a defining difference between the parvo- and magnocellular systems. further, they surmise that detection of surface characteristics at low temporal frequencies may be due to processing further on in the visual system, based on the fact that cortical neurons have longer integration times, compared to the subcortical neurons found in the magno- and parvocellular systems. quaid and flanagan recommend looking to the dorsal stream for illusory contour processing, claiming that motion-defined-forms may be detected, even with a magnocellular deficit. they also point out that the dorsal stream mediates low contrast, high temporal frequency stimuli, as well as motion, making it a viable candidate for processing this illusion. when addressing the theory that magnocellular deficits play a potential role in dyslexia, skottun and skoyles argue that it may be more of an overall temporal processing deficit, not just a magnocelluar deficit. they claim the inability of dyslexic children to process stimuli that change rapidly or occur briefly may be unrelated to the magnocellular system. ultimately, they conclude that further research is needed to back the theory that phantom contours and surface characteristics are caused by the magnocelluar and parvocellular systems, respectively, and, therefore, it would be wise not to limit one\\'s research of phantom contours and surface characteristics exclusively to the analysis of how the magno- and parvocellular systems function. references optical illusions',\n",

       " 'in chemistry, metal vapor synthesis (mvs) is a method for preparing metal complexes by combining freshly produced metal atoms or small particles with ligands. in contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands. the method has been used to prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by traditional synthetic methods, e.g. ti(η6-toluene)2. the technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand. the metal evaporates upon being heated resistively or irradiated with an electron beam. the apparatus operates under high vacuum. in a common implementation, the metal vapor and the organic ligand are co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures. in several case where compounds are prepared by mvs, related preparations employ conventional routes. thus, tris(butadiene)molybdenum was first prepared by co-condensation of butadiene and mo vapor, but yields are higher for the reduction of molybdenum(v) chloride in the presence of the diene. references chemical processes vacuum',\n",

       " 'air one s.p.a. was an italian low-cost airline which operated as air one \"smart carrier\". it operated as alitalia\\'s low-cost subsidiary with operating bases located in catania, palermo, pisa, venice and verona; while tirana was a focus city. \"air one\" is a portmanteau of the english meaning air one and the italian word \\'airone\\', pronounced ipa [ai\\'rone], meaning heron (the bird depicted in the airline\\'s logo), which was also the airline\\'s callsign. before the merger with alitalia, air one was a competitor, the second largest airline in italy, with a network to 36 destinations in italy, europe and north america. its main bases were leonardo da vinci-fiumicino airport in rome, linate airport in milan and turin airport. air one ceased operations on 30 october 2014 as part of the new concept of its parent company alitalia based on its new partnership with etihad airways. all routes were either cancelled or taken over by alitalia itself. history first years on 27 april 1995 aliadriatica began scheduled flights between milan (linate) and brindisi and reggio calabria and lamezia terme. in the year 2000, air one announced a partnership with lufthansa and nearly all air one flights became code-shared with lufthansa. as of june 2006, regional destinations were served under the name air one cityliner with the brand new fleet of bombardier crj-900s. in 2007, air one carried approximately 5.5 million passengers (scheduled and charter), thus becoming the second largest italian airline in terms of passenger traffic. 2007 revenues totaled eur750 million with a net profit of eur6.8 million. merger with alitalia in august 2008, it was announced that air one was to be merged with alitalia. air one was almost bankrupt in 2008, and the merger with alitalia-cai was the only viable solution to save it. on 13 january 2009, air one officially became part of alitalia, though the two airlines were to be combined into one over time. a detailed integration plan was at that time yet to be announced. on 28 march 2009, due to the merger with alitalia, the cooperation between lufthansa\\'s miles & more and air one ended. on 28 june 2009, also due to the alitalia merger, the partnerships with united airlines\\' mileage plus program and air canada\\'s aeroplan program ended. later in 2009, the alitalia and air one booking procedures were unified so that the airlines effectively became the same. air one \"smart carrier\" - low cost subsidiary on 28 march 2010, air one smart carrier as a separate brand from alitalia began operating low-cost flights out of milan malpensa airport. nine domestic and five international destinations were initially served, using five airbus a320s painted in the air one livery and formatted to 180 seats. in its first full quarter of operations, air one smart carrier transported 320 000 passengers, with an on-time performance of 89%. on 2 february 2011, air one smart carrier announced that, in the summer 2011 season, it would expand its operations at milan malpensa and also open a new base at pisa airport. the base opened on 1 july 2011. air one smart carrier predicted it would carry 1,6 million passengers in 2011, compared to 0,9 million in 2010, and a new website was also launched. on 21 december 2011, air one smart carrier announced a new base at venice marco polo airport, with flights starting in may 2012. on 1 october 2012, operations commenced at air one smart carrier\\'s new base in catania fontanarossa airport, the fourth base. in september 2013 the opening of a fifth base at palermo falcone-borsellino airport was announced with flights to commence in march 2014. including a new route to london gatwick airport, a destination not served by air one since the ending of flights from milan malpensa airport. on 26 october 2013, air one closed its operating base in milan malpensa airport and announced a new base at palermo falcone-borsellino airport. the flights from palermo started in march 2014. closure on 26 august 2014, it was announced that parent-company alitalia would shut down air one by autumn 2014. all remaining routes were terminated by 30 october 2014 with some base operations and routes already closed by 30 september. some routes, especially within italy, have been taken over by alitalia itself as well as the former air one fleet. fleet history air one operated the following aircraft types over its lifetime: the air one fleet progression over the years: in january 2006, the airline signed a contract with airbus for 30 airbus a320s and 60 options, to replace the carrier\\'s leased fleet of boeing 737-400s. in may 2007, the airline announced the conversion of options and purchase rights for 50 airbus a320s into firm orders, bringing its commitment to the type to 90 aircraft. in june 2008, the airline ordered 24 aircraft from airbus for 4.8 billion dollars. air one also had an option to buy another 20 aircraft for 3.8 billion dollars. the order included 12 airbus a330s and 12 a350s. the order was transferred to alitalia when air one ceased operations. see also list of defunct airlines of italy references external links official website official website of air one executive defunct airlines of italy airlines established in 1983 airlines disestablished in 2014 alitalia italian companies established in 1983 italian companies disestablished in 2014',\n",

       " \"mirza aqa khan kermani (;\\u200e 1854 - 1896/97) was an iranian intellectual reformer, a babi, and son-in-law of subh-i-azal. in his writings, he advocates for political, social, and religious reform characteristic of his generation of intellectuals whose reformist ideas and engagement with sociopolitical themes set the stage for the constitutional revolution of 1906, and the political and literary changes that were to follow. kermani was also a literary critic and like many of his contemporaries an advocate of simpler, more accessible prose. he believed that meaning as opposed to the mode of expression exerts real influence on the reader. he thus discouraged the destruction of the natural clarity of language by means of complicated metaphors, difficult words, long sentences, and complex expressions. life mirza aqa khan kermani was born in 1854 in kerman into a family with a proper position on the socio-economic ladder. there, he was schooled in mathematics, natural science, and theology (ḥekmat-i ilāhī) and also learned some french and english. he was influenced by voltaire. at age 32, because of hardship he faced from the governor of kerman, he moved to isfahan and then tehran where he taught qur'anic interpretation (tafsīr). eventually, he ended up in istanbul where many iranian intellectuals resided. there, he wrote letters to the ulema and statesmen of iran and elsewhere calling for islamic unity and attacked nasir al-din shah and his court, including prime minister mirza ali asghar khan amin al-soltan. these attacks motivated the prime minister to seek kermani's blood, instructing the iranian ambassador to istanbul to convince the ottomans that kermani had played a role in the armenian riots two years earlier. eventually, the ottomans turned kermani over to iranian authorities and he was executed. three essays (se maktūb) of his most influential texts advocating for reform is three essays (se maktūb). like many of his contemporaries, kermani has an idealized image of pre-islamic iran. he thus praises pre-islamic iran for the geographic vastness of her lands, the virtues and mercy of her kings aided by wise court advisers and zoroastrian clergy, the order of her fighting men, and the all-encompassing rule of law that governed her lands. this pre-islamic iran is then contrasted with the current state of affairs under the qajar kings. kermani devotes his energies to the critique of the shah, though no names are mentioned, and men in court service. their mismanagement, kermani tells us compels many talented men to leave iran for india, istanbul, and europe. in addition to political actors, social groupings are also subject to kermani's critical pen: merchants are criticized for their immoral trade practices, young men are scorned for their laziness and uselessness, and agents of handicrafts are condemned for their lack of skills. kermani is distressed over social customs regarding women and marriage. women's isolation, he asserts, causes men to pursue sexual acts with children (bache bāzī) while causing depression for women. moreover, arranged marriages are a problem as they bond two people who have never met—a prescription for disaster and a life replete with discord, kermani believes. the utopic pre-islamic iran is thus contrasted with the current iran, which suffers from unjust rulers and a problem-riddled society. this, kermani claims, is caused by two phenomena: the arab invasions of the seventh century and the corruption of islam by ulema, sufis, and popular superstition. according to kermani, barbaric arabs who considered themselves superior imposed unprecedented suffering on iran and instituted unjust rule, for instance executing men for prostrating before their kings. the ulema corroborated iran's destruction at the hand of arabs by deviating from original islam of muhammad—which god had sent to civilize arab tribes—they introduced plenty of gibberish and minor issues such as rules of ritual purity. ritual washing before prayer made sense for unhygienic arabs, kermani asserts, but should be of little concern to iran's princes who bathe frequently. however, the ulema are preoccupied with such minor issues even when the social context makes their application irrelevant and have moved far away from the simple shariah of original islam. muslims themselves are to blame too. they have invented sects and are caught up in superstitions believing in non-nonsensical stories of the ulema. kermani gives the example of the safavid-era jurists like muhammad baqir majlisi and mir damad declaring as ludicrous their detailed accounts of life after death, for example that of believers after death turning into melodious birds while polytheists turn into black crows. selected works āyīnah-i sekandarī (alexandrian mirror), nashr-i chashmah fann-i guftan va nivishtan (art of speaking and writing) hasht bihisht (eight heavens) jang-i haftād va du

       " 'the irish republican army (ira), a paramilitary group seeking to remove northern ireland from the united kingdom and unify ireland, shared intelligence with the abwehr, the military intelligence service of nazi germany, during the second world war. context conquest of ireland was not a strategic goal for nazi germany before or during world war ii. a plan existed for a potential invasion of ireland, operation green, but it was more a diversionary tactic than an actual plot to take over the territory. what nazi germany hoped was to see ireland remain neutral. when german attempts to gain air superiority over great britain as part of the battle of britain, seen as a potential precursor to operation sea lion, were repulsed ireland largely ceased to be of much interest. ira-abwehr involvement throughout the period can be broken up into three phases: coordination missions with the ira preceding the french campaign, military missions directed against britain for the purposes of gathering technical and weather data sending german soldiers into the irish ranks political missions against britain undertaken later in the war, when the threat of direct german action against britain had receded. each phase had similar characteristics: a lack of planning, and a lack of capabilities of all the organisations concerned. german efforts to cultivate a working relationship with the ira formed the basis for two wartime missions; that of ernst weber-drohl, and that of hermann görtz, but the abwehr later chose to rely on support mechanisms exclusive of the ira. neither strategy proved viable and the entire process was one disaster after another. the missions of the first phase are covered in detail below, followed by a list of missions covering the two remaining phases. 1937-1939: the first ira contacts the abwehr had german agents in ireland at this point. joseph hoven was an anthropology student who spent much of 1938 and 1939 in northern ireland and the province of connacht. hoven had befriended tom barry, an ira member who had fought during the anglo-irish war and was still active within the organisation. they met frequently with a view to fostering links between the ira and germany. at this time barry had taken up the position of ira chief of staff and it was within this capacity that he visited germany in 1937 accompanied by hoven, with a view to developing ira/german relations. upon his return to ireland, barry presented his findings to the ira general army convention (gac) during april 1938 in the guise of the \"barry plan\"a campaign focussed on targets in the border region of northern ireland. this plan was rejected by the gac in favour of a competing plan to solely attack targets in britainthe s-plan sanctioned by seán russell. seán macbride, the son of john macbride and barry\\'s director of intelligence, is also known to have handled a contact with an ex-german army officer named bismarck, who was in ireland attempting to sell armoured cars to the irish army in 1937. the intelligence director for the dublin brigade of the ira, con lehane is also said to have helped macbride with handling proposals about the ira being absorbed into the irish military. 1939-1940 in december 1938, the abwehr ii. ast., located at knochenhauerstraße, hamburg, took an english-speaking agent on loan from the english section of the deutscher fichte-bund headquarters (hq) in hamburg. this agent was oscar c. pfaus. around this time, the ira, independently of german intelligence, began a series of attacks on targets in britain following a declaration of war on the british state. pfaus was familiarised with media reports of this campaign and given a mission:\"to seek out the ira leadership; make contact; ask if they would be interested in cooperation with germany; and, if so, to send a liaison man to germany to discuss specific plans and future co-ordination.\" pfaus\\'s mission did not include a military component and he was not given authorisation to discuss items of an intelligence nature. in preparation for his mission, pfaus was to later meet with the officer in charge of office 1 west, abwehr ii hq- hauptmann friedrich carl marwede, codenamed \"dr. pfalzgraf\". on reaching ireland, the contact pfaus had been given was a former member of the ira\\'s 3rd battalion, liam walsh, who was a friend and confidant of eoin o\\'duffy, and then employed at the italian legation. pfaus was unaware at the time of the meeting that the fascist blueshirts had been ideologically hostile to the ira, but did secure from walsh a meeting with an ira contact. a meeting between pfaus and ira representatives took place on 13 february 1939. pfaus reported that those included in the meeting were moss twomey, the new cs. sean russell, and seamus (jim) o\\'donovan. pfaus found himself unable or unauthorized to answer all the questions of the ira, so an arrangement to send an ira representative to germany for substantive talks was made. following this meeting russell decided to send o\\'donovan, within one week, as the ira\\'s representative. bowyer bell puts it so:\"russell, elated by the prospect of german arms, ammunition, and money to supplement the thin stream of clan na gael aid, decided to entrust the mission to seamus o\\'donovan.\" the figures involved included eduard hempel and \"three members of the nazi party\" in dublin. the meeting took place in county donegal and general eoin o\\'duffy, seamus burke, and theodor kordt (attached to the german embassy in london) were reportedly responsible for making the arrangements. another meeting reportedly took place in louisburgh, county mayo between hempel, o\\'duffy, and members of the ira in august 1939. seamus o\\'donovan o\\'donovan, a german speaker, made three trips to germany in 1939. the first meeting in february saw o\\'donovan conduct discussions with the head of office 1 west, abwehr hqfriedrich carl marwede, codenamed \"dr. pfalzgraf\". o\\'donovan and marwede discussed the appropriate wartime role of the ira as it concerned the german government. the germans were adamant they could not supply immediate help for the ira in its s-plan campaign in britain. other areas of concern for the germans were that they were unsure how the ira intended to attack targets in northern ireland and how to supply arms to the group. o\\'donovan returned to ireland with these concerns with after being given the codename \"v-held\" (agent hero in german). he returned to germany on 26 april 1939 for more meetings with marwede, this time to discuss radio contact, a courier route for messages and armaments, and the location of a safe house in london for use in the courier route. by the time o\\'donovan returned to ireland on 15 may, russell had left for the united states as part of the propaganda arm of the s-plan and installed stephen hayes as acting cs. the final meeting o\\'donovan took part in was in august 1939 when he brought his wife with him. this series of meetings was also attended by joseph mcgarrity, the leader of clan na gael and monty barry, his wife and sister of the late kevin barry. according to o\\'donovan\\'s diaries, he was escorted to the meetings by a representative of the german foreign ministry. the topics under discussion were: the possibility of reviving the english campaign in the event of war, the ira capabilities in england, northern ireland, and ireland, the policies, intentions and probable reactions of the dublin government to any outbreak of hostilities between nazi germany and britain, the standard of ira capabilities and their exact arms requirements. o\\'donovan notes in his diary that his hosts told him that there would be a war \"probably within one week.\" a few days later, on 1 september 1939, germany invaded poland. communication problems the radio transmitter that was supplied to the ira by joseph mcgarrity proved to lack the range to reach germany, and the ira began using it for propaganda broadcasts- leading to its swift capture by the irish authorities on 29 december 1939. during its capture, they also found evidence of attempts at coded transmissions to nazi germany. though the transmitter had been captured, o\\'donovan, up to his internment in september 1941, was to continue monitoring and transcribing coded broadcasts from germany. in many cases, the reception was weak or blocked. the existing logs show an almost continuous period of monitoring from january through to september 1940. 30/12/39 - owing to illness and lack of decision, no reception. 24/01/40 - conditions bad. 14/02/40 - morse receiver did not turn up. abandoned. 09/03/40 - almost perfect except for what came in like jamming in each of three repeats. however reconstructed blanks ok. 13/03/40 - untrained morse man. says got rvk and a number but no message. military and political mission phases by that stage of events, each ira chief of staff., from 1937 onwards, had been involved in liaisons with the germans to one degree or another. those liaisons were to continue into the tenure of stephen hayes and his overture to nazi germany via \"plan kathleen\" in 1940. once hayes was exposed as a traitor to the ira, there was a power shift within the organisation, which led to the futile northern campaign in 1942. the ira\\'s northern command was briefed on the previous liaisons with the germans but they appear not to have grasped how fragile and scant they were. that power shift, the restrictions imposed on the ira during \"the emergency\", and the change in fortunes for the german forces in world war ii, effectively ended the liaison between the ira and abwehr. the abwehr kept attempting to conduct operations in ireland, but the majority of those operations were stillborn and never took place, or were total fiascos. however, those attempts were made without the knowledge of the ira. it was demoralised and militarily moribund, and even the ability to gather fruitful intelligence was gone. the contacts prior to 1940 had expressed an intent by the ira to assist in the german campaign against britain. from the ira\\'s point of view, that was a means to a united ireland - they had no love for the policies of éamon de valera, winston churchill, adolf hitler, or joseph stalin. the 1938 takeover by russell, and a reaffirmation of the \"second dáil mentality\" with his succession, placed the organisation on a path from which it viewed its only recourse as \"violent struggle against the forces of foreign occupation\". the ira did wish to see for the defeat of britain by germany, perceiving that it would lead to an immediate end of british control over northern ireland. the abwehr, as it did in other nations, made much of encouraging that state of mind within the ira. that included attempts, via german agents, to keep alive the tenuous links, formed mostly by o\\'donovan. what solidified that as german policy was the 1940 ira arms raid on the magazine fort, in dublin. the event gave an entirely misleading positive impression to the nazi authorities about the ira\\'s capabilities. another factor was the failure of the incompetent german agent, hermann görtz, to relay back comprehensive details on his meeting with ira cs, stephen hayes, after discussing plan kathleen. due to those factors, the german authorities had to learn the hard way, through failed missions, that the ira at that point in time was far less militarily capable than they had hoped. see also german agents adolf mahr hermann görtz günther

       " 'northwood house is a country manor house in cowes on the isle of wight in the united kingdom. the current building dates back to 1799 and was built for the london businessman george ward, remaining in his family for five generations. it is a grade ii listed building, said to have a ground floor area of around 15,000 square feet. in 1929, northwood house and its 26-acre \"pleasure park\", known as northwood park, were gifted by the wards to cowes urban district council. the gift was conditional upon the house being used as municipal offices and the grounds ‘as pleasure gardens for the people of cowes\\'. in 2010, after 81 years of operating as council offices, the council withdrew and handed the house and estate over to a charitable trust to administer. today this georgian manor house is looked after and run by the northwood house charitable trust co. ltd. their aim is to preserve the building and its grounds for the enjoyment of future generations. its grounds are open to the public and its buildings are available to hire or to let by the general public as an events centre. this is typically for weddings, parties and conferences. current usage there are currently seven main rooms in the house which are available for hire for events, conferences and special occasions. these are the ball room, the dining room, the drawing room, the morning room, the library, the rotunda and the house bar. wedding ceremonies can be held in the first six of these rooms, with the ball room being able to seat 120 people. there are other smaller rooms available in the house to hire or to let for longer periods. there is also a converted stable block in the grounds, which is now known as the community hall. as well as being available for private functions, the 26-acre estate also hosts a number of public events each year and still has its original tennis courts and bowling green. the original icehouse still remains, half buried in the grounds of northwood house. there are thought to be about fifteen icehouses remaining on the isle of wight. there is also a war memorial in the grounds, dedicated to those who lost their lives in the first world war. it was originally located at the junction of the high street and market hill, but was itself damaged in an air raid during the second world war. the remains were relocated to northwood park and it now stands as a memorial to both wars. surrounding the original entrance-way into the house, the tarmac area has now been converted into a pay short-stay car park, for public use. history the ward family held the estate through six generations from 1793 until 1929. the road which runs in front of the house is named ward avenue in their honour. however, they also owned a huge amount of land across the isle of wight and also resided at weston manor in freshwater. the successive owners of the estate are as follows: the ward family george ward (1793-1829) in 1793, george ward esq, a highly successful merchant banker from broad street in the city of london, bought at auction the cowes estate of bellevue, which consisted of belle vue house and seventeen acres of land. the house was described as a \\'modern brick dwelling house\\', with four rooms on each floor and an excellent wine cellar. in 1799, he largely demolished belle vue house and built northwood house on its site, with the grounds being renamed to northwood park. the only part of belle vue which still exists are the large cellars underneath northwood house, said to have been originally built to hide smuggled goods. by this time, ward had also acquired more land in cowes, including debourne farm, bringing the estate up to 217 acres. the driveway, leading up to the house, was by that time almost a mile long. the changes to the house were designed by john nash, the famous london architect. nash also designed buckingham palace as well as many other island properties, including east cowes castle, the iw county club and st mildred\\'s church, whippingham. the walls surrounding the estate were built from bembridge limestone, taken from brading harbour. ward\\'s wealth originated from his grandfather, john ward and his father, who was also called john ward. both of whom were highly successful businessmen. however, aside from this, in 1783, his father also won a half-share of a £20,000 state-run lottery win. this is worth over a million pounds today. george ward was also the older brother of robert plumer ward, the barrister, politician and novelist who was mp for cockermouth between 1802 and 1806. amongst other things, george ward made his own fortune by lending money to the government during the napoleonic wars at highly beneficial rates of interest. he used his money to buy more and more land on the isle of wight, eventually amassing around 20,000 acres, said to be one fifth of the island\\'s area. due to the enormous amounts of land that he owned by this time, his nickname was \\'king ward\\'. ward was also a director of the east india docks in london. in 1798, george ward was nominated as a new sheriff in the court of exchequer in 1803, his wife mary had a baby daughter, born at the house. however, in 1813, she died of a paralytic stroke. in 1813, george ward started the first paddle steamer service between cowes and southampton. the isle of wight royal mail steam packet company would eventually become the company now known as red funnel. in 1817, a duel took place at northwood house between major orlando lockyer and lieutenant john sutton, after lockyer took offense to a comment made by sutton, whilst both were drinking one night. in the morning, at the agreed duelling place, it was said that sutton apologised and informed lockyer that he would not return fire against him. lockyer still asked for the signal to fire and when the handkerchief was dropped, shot sutton through the heart without sutton even unstopping his pistol. before dying, sutton staggered forward and held out his hand, which lockyer took. lockyer and his seconds then fled the scene. at the coroner\\'s inquest, the jury returned a verdict of \\'wilful murder\\' against lockyer and his two seconds, who at that time had still not been apprehended. in their subsequent trial at the winchester assizes, they were charged with murder. lockyer said that he had been under the most gross provocation and that he had asked for sutton to make a concession which would make the duel unnecessary, but that sutton refused and was obstinate to the last. the defendants were found guilty of manslaughter and given three months\\' imprisonment each. john sutton is buried in the next door st mary\\'s church graveyard. in 1821, to celebrate the coronation of george iv, a grand celebration for the poor people of northwood and cowes was held at northwood house. a feast for 2,000 people was prepared and it was seen as an opportunity for them to testify their loyalty and joy to the new king. as well as giving use of his estate, ward donated 50 guineas towards the total cost of 200 guineas, for the food and the entertainment. in 1823, ward was commended for his \\'munificent\\' generosity in distributing six bullocks and ten chaldrons of coals amongst the \\'poor and deserving objects\\' of cowes. george had a famous and talented son, the cricketer william ward. following in the family footsteps, william was also a noted financier. but as a cricketer, he scored the first-ever first-class double-century and his score of 278 for the mcc v norfolk in 1820, remained the highest ever first-class score for 56 years, until it was finally beaten by w. g. grace in 1876, with a score of 344. the ball that ward played with is held in the mcc museum and is thought to be the oldest in existence. william ward can also be thanked for saving the famous lord\\'s cricket ground from being sold to a housing developer in 1825. he stepped in and bought the lease, to prevent this from happening. in 1817, william was elected as a director of the bank of england and was an expert on foreign exchanges. in 1826, william ward became mp for the city of london. william ward missed out on inheriting the estate by just three months, dying just before his older brother, george henry ward. however, his son inherited the estate in his place. george ward died at the age of 78 in 1829, leaving an estate said to be worth upwards of £700,000 at the time. george henry ward (1829-1849) in 1829, following the death of george ward, his first-born son george henry ward inherited the estate. in 1837, he vastly renovated the house, incorporating a new western wing, entrance pavilion and classical side wall. as well as inheriting the estate, he also inherited his father\\'s nickname, \\'king ward\\'. in 1835, ward contested the election for member of parliament of the isle of wight, but was ultimately defeated by sir richard simeon, both being important isle of wight land-owners. sir richard simeon had directed his tenants to vote for whoever they liked. however, it was said that you couldn\\'t find one person on george ward\\'s estate that would dare to vote against him. it was a very acrimonious campaign, with some violent outbreaks. during the official nomination, events got very heated and another fight broke out. one elector asked ward if it was true that he had promised a local family that he would arrange for the release from prison of several members of their family in return for them voting for him. ward replied by saying that he wouldn\\'t answer that question. ward was described as a man of \\'retired habits who seldom took part in the affairs of cowes\\'. he was in fact also a county magistrate, although he refused to act in that capacity. in 1845, northwood house received a visit by prince albert and sir edward bowater, who spent two hours viewing the house and its grounds. g h ward had recently spent £20,000 on \\'embellishments by foreign artists\\' and had spared no expense in laying out the grounds. it was considered that they contained the finest collection of evergreens in england. in 1846, he entertained sir george hamilton seymour, the minister at brussels. sir george was the son of lord george seymour, who owned the nearby norris castle. george henry ward married mary saunders, daughter of mr richard saunders esq. however, she died in 1938, having had no children, leaving george henry ward with no immediate heir. the next in line to the estate was william george ward, the son of george henry ward\\'s younger brother, the famous cricketer, william ward. william ward only just missed out on inheriting the estate himself, as he died on 30 june 1849, just three months before his older brother george henry ward, who died on 29 september 1849. this did not prevent his son from inheriting the estate, as still the next in line. william george ward (1849-1882) following his uncle\\'s death, the estate passed to william george ward, a theologian and mathematician. in 1834 he was awarded an open fellowship at balliol college, oxford, for his work in mathematics. he also published many articles on ethics, religion and moral philosophy, having converted from the church of england to the roman catholic church in 1845. in 1851, he became a professor of moral philosophy at st edmund\\'s college, ware and in 1863 he became editor of the dublin review, a catholic periodical. in 1852, it was reported that northwood house had been leased for a period of ten years, to be used as a catholic seminary. however, by 1853, it was written that the house was occupied by robert white esq, as an educational establishment. later, by 1858, the house was again occupied by its rightful owner, william george ward. in 1858, william ward gave part of the grounds to the people of cowes, to be used as public walks and a playground. it was proposed that the lower part be used for walks and the upper part as a cricket ground. his father had of course been an eminent first-class cricketer. in 1858, ward was visited by cardinal wiseman. by 1864, the house was occupied by a mr stephenson, but this must have been for a relatively brief period. by 1867, it was occupied by a james dunkin lee, after laying vacant for a long time. in 1871, ward moved the family seat to totland, building weston manor and headon hall, at alum bay. his nickname was \\'ideal\\' ward. edmund granville ward (1882-1915) following his father\\'s death, the estate passed to his eldest son, edmund granville ward. he went on to marry gertrude jane mary dormer, daughter of hon. hubert francis dormer on 28 may 1885. however, the marriage was annulled in 1896. he died on 2 september 1915. however, edmund\\'s family home was egypt house, egypt hill, cowes and so the house lay empty for some years. however, shortly after acquiring it, edmund did allow the house to be used by the royal yacht squadron in 1882 to hold a grand ball in honour of hrh prince of wales, who had recently been appointed commodore of the squadron. in attendance were his wife, the princess of wales and many of the noblemen of the day. the guest list included marquis, viscounts, earls, lords, counts, knights, many men of military rank and their partners. entertainment was provided by the hungarian band and all the men attending had to wear man-of-war jackets of blue cloth with brass buttons, blue trousers, white waistcoats with a black tie. this uniform was said to be a revival of an even older fashion, which was said to be \\'very becoming for men who are not too square built\\'. in 1884, northwood house was used by lord petre to accommodate the forty to fifty boys of his woburn school, after his school in weybridge was sold. shortly afterwards in 1885, a football match was held at northwood house, between the boys of woburn house and cowes football club, which resulted in a 1-1 draw. not long after this, the school failed, like his weybridge school before it. in 1886, the royal yacht squadron again held their annual ball at northwood house, with the hungarian band again supplying the music. it was a truly royal event. amongst the attendees were the prince and princess of wales, the crown prince and princess of germany, princesses victoria, margaret and sophia of germany, the duchess of edinburgh, princess louise, princess henry of battenberg, prince albert victor, prince george, the princesses louise, victoria and maud of wales, princess irene of hesse and the maharaja of cooch behar. in 1889, the isle of wight county council sold off its remaining toll houses. the northwood house toll house was sold for £30 to the west council local board. granville ward also generously gave all of the tenants of his ward estate, a rent reduction of 15%. in august 1889, a grand garden party was held at northwood house, which was again attended by the prince and princess of wales and the princesses victoria and maud. it was held to raise money for the organ and vestry fund of the cowes holy trinity church. other attendees included princess louise, the marquis of lorne, prince hermann of saxe-weimar and his wife and many lords and ladies of their day. music was provided by the band of the oxfordshire light infantry. lord colville\\'s black poodle received much praise for collecting money for the appeal, by wandering appealingly amongst the guests with a money-box around its neck. regretfully the party was abruptly curtailed when a deluge of rain spoiled the proceedings. in 1891, northwood house was placed at the disposal of prince henry of battenberg and his wife beatrice, daughter of queen victoria. they held a grand ball there, attended by several members of the royal family and 300 notable inhabitants of the isle of wight. amongst those present were the duke and duchess of connaught and the duke of clarence, once rumoured to be a candidate for being jack the ripper. others included the marquis of lorne, count mensdorff and lord and lady tennyson. the event was described as the most brilliant gathering that has ever taken place on the island. the purpose for the event was to celebrate prince henry being named governor of the isle of wight and keeper of carisbrooke castle, in succession to the late viscount eversley. although she did not attend the event, queen victoria visited the house beforehand to witness the preparations. the event was to be held at osborne house, but for the fact that the new banqueting hall had not been completed there. but, between 1901 and 1906, northwood house became a convent for 80 benedictine nuns, who were expelled from france when a new law was passed. the law enabled the french government to close any religious establishments which were jesuit, dominican or benedictine. among many internal alterations, the ballroom was turned into a chapel, being the largest room in the building. their life at northwood was very insular and they were said to never leave its grounds, except in the case of utmost necessity. one of the nuns was princess adelaide of löwenstein-wertheim-rosenberg, widow of the duke of braganza, who died in 1866. it was the generosity of the princess that allowed the nuns to settle in their former home in solesmes, france. around the same time in 1901, benedictine monks also settled in to appuldurcombe house on the isle of wight, before eventually moving to quarr abbey where they still reside today. the nuns at northwood house were visited in 1902 by the new king and queen, whilst touring the isle of wight. they visited the new convent there and its chapel. in 1905, the nuns were visited by more royalty, entertaining the queen of saxony. then in 1906, princess ena who was soon to be married to the king of spain, was a regular visitor, attending mass with the nuns. in 1906, the nuns secured a college in ryde as their permanent home and left northwood house. later, in 1909, northwood park was turned into a nine-hole golf course. wilfrid philip ward (1915-1916) lacking an heir, the estate then briefly passed to edmund\\'s younger brother, wilfrid philip ward, an essayist and biographer. at the time, he was a lecturer at lowell institute, boston and like his father, he also became editor of the dublin review. he also wrote at least four biographies, including that of his father, cardinal wiseman, aubrey thomas de vere and cardinal newman. he was also one of the founders of the \\'synthetic society\\', a knowledge community that was formed from a lunchtime discussion that he had with the former prime minister arthur balfour in 1896. the community discussed issues such as agnostic tendencies and religious belief. ward was described as being one of \"the two leading lay english catholic thinkers of their generation\" and was a prominent member of the oxford movement. wilfrid ward was married to josephine mary hope-scott, daughter of james hope-scott and lady victoria howard, daughter of the duke of norfolk. living at weston manor, totland, he was said to be a neighbour and intimate friend of lord tennyson. he died in 1916, leaving an estate valued at £10,658. during the first world war, northwood house was requisitioned by the war office and it was used as a red cross military hospital. in 1915, princess louis of battenberg and her daughter princess louise, later to become queen of sweden, visited the red cross hospital to visit the sick and wounded soldiers there. later that same year, the soldiers were visited by princess henry of battenberg and princess louise, duchess of argyll. between 1914 and 1919, when the hospital closed, it had treated 1894 patients. captain herbert joseph ward (1916-1929) following his father\\'s death, the estate passed to captain herbert joseph ward, who like many of his predecessors, preferred to live elsewhere. captain ward lived at egypt house, cowes; and so since the closure of the red cross hospital in 1919, northwood house had been unoccupied. in 1919, ward started to sell off much of the family lands and in 1929, he made the decision to give the house and its remaining 29 acres of land to the people of cowes, to be managed by the cowes urban district council. the house was to be used as municipal offices and the land to be converted into pleasure parks for the people of cowes. captain ward died in 1967. the isle of wight council years (1929-2010) in 1929, captain herbert joseph ward, a jp and chairman of the council, gifted the house and estate to cowes urban district council. the deeds to the property were received by hrh princess beatrice on 4 september 1929 in her capacity as royal governor of the isle of wight. she in turn, handed them to mr f. w. beken, chairman of cowes urban district council. the following year, tennis courts were built for public use. during the second world war the house was also used as a red cross first-aid station and as a base for air raid precaution wardens. parts of the ground were used for growing vegetables under the war effort\\'s \\'dig for victory\\' campaign, and there was also an air-raid shelter on the site. there are reports that a bomb fell on the tennis courts. in 1940, a charity event was held at northwood house, to raise money for the spitfire fund. a captured messerschmitt was put on display for the event. later in 1941, a concert was held at northwood house to entertain the troops, although embarrassingly, only five soldiers turned up and the concert was cancelled. in 1947, a bowling green was added to the estate. the current pavilion was built in 1983/84, when the existing one burnt down. in august 1965, over 800 guests attended the royal yacht squadron\\'s annual ball at northwood house. among the guests was prince philip and the spanish ambassador. in 1998, the isle of wight council received an offer from a developer, who planned to convert the house into a hotel. however, a public group was formed, calling themselves \\'friends of northwood house\\', who fought the proposal. they won and the idea was shelved. as early as 2002, a charitable scheme was set up, with local citizens being designated as \"management trustees\". in this way, although the council continued to utilize the building, including its use as a registrar\\'s office, it was jointly looked after by both the council and volunteers. in 2004, the isle of wight council renovated the downstairs rooms and moved the island\\'s registrar\\'s office into northwood house. northwood house charitable trust co ltd (2010 to date) in 2010, the isle of wight council completely withdrew from northwood house, with the registrar\\'s office and other council functions being moved elsewhere. this left the property\\'s use and maintenance totally in the hands of the volunteers of the charitable trust. however, in 2012, the management structure was changed when the original trust was replaced by the northwood house charitable trust co. ltd. the estate continues to depend on the help of volunteers to maintain and operate it. the trades needed for the house include master craftsmen, cleaners, soft furnishing specialists and restoration workers. for the grounds, they need gardeners, arborists and landscape designers. references external links northwood house & park web site

       " \"the blondie film series is an american comedy film series based on the comic strip of the same name, created by chic young. the series featured penny singleton as blondie bumstead and arthur lake as dagwood bumstead. concurrently the film adventures were continued, with the same cast reprising their roles, in the blondie radio series. columbia pictures produced the films from 1938 to 1943, and popular demand brought them back in 1945. columbia later reissued the blondie features, beginning with the first film in the series. columbia used the series to showcase many of its contract players. rita hayworth was featured in blondie on a budget; glenn ford in blondie plays cupid, larry parks and janet blair in blondie goes to college, shemp howard in blondie knows best, and adele jergens in blondie's anniversary. other roles were taken by columbia contractees doris houck, bruce bennett, lloyd bridges, ann doran, stanley brown, richard fiske, bud jamison, eddie laughton, john tyrrell, alyn lockwood, jimmy lloyd, gay nelson, and ross ford. faithfulness to the comic strip was a major concern of the creators of the movie series. little touches were added that were iconic to the strip, like the appearance of dagwood's famous sandwiches - and the running gag of dagwood colliding with the mailman amid a flurry of letters, (which preceded the title sequence in almost every film). the films were typical of family-fare situational comedies of the period, and are endearingly funny in a low-key way. as the series progressed, the bumstead children grew from toddlers to young adults onscreen. larry simms as baby dumpling (later known as alexander) reprised his role in all the films. daughter cookie was played by three different child actresses, beginning in 1942 with her first appearance (as an infant) in blondie's blessed event, the eleventh entry in the series. daisy had pups in the twelfth episode, blondie for victory (1942). rounding out the regular supporting cast, character actor jonathan hale played dagwood's irascible boss, j.c. dithers. the bumsteads' neighbors, the woodleys, were oddly missing from the series. the woodleys were in the last film, beware of blondie. films twenty-eight films were produced by columbia pictures between 1938 and 1950: blondie (1938) blondie meets the boss (1939) blondie takes a vacation (1939) blondie brings up baby (1939) blondie on a budget (1940) blondie has servant trouble (1940) blondie plays cupid (1940) blondie goes latin (1941) blondie in society (1941) blondie goes to college (1942) blondie's blessed event (1942) blondie for victory (1942) it's a great life (1943) footlight glamour (1943) leave it to blondie (1945) life with blondie (1945) blondie's lucky day (1946) blondie knows best (1946) blondie's big moment (1947) blondie's holiday (1947) blondie in the dough (1947) blondie's anniversary (1947) blondie's reward (1948) blondie's secret (1948) blondie's big deal (1949) blondie hits the jackpot (1949) blondie's hero (1950) beware of blondie (1950) references further reading blondie goes to hollywood, by carol lynn scherling. albany, 2010. bearmanor media. . american film series comedy film series films based on american comics films based on comic strips live-action films based on comics\",\n",

       " '\"one mic\" is a song by american rapper nas, released april 16, 2002 on columbia records and distributed through ill will records in the united states. it was issued as the third single from his fifth studio album, stillmatic (2001). the single peaked at number 43 on the billboard hot 100, making it nas\\'s third top-fifty hit on the chart. music and production production for \"one mic\" was handled by nas and hip hop producer chucky thompson. talking about the inspiration for the song, nas stated: \"i\\'m a huge fan of phil collins and i just wanted to take the vibe from \\'in the air tonight\\'.\" steve juon of rapreviews wrote that the song features a production technique previously implemented by such hip hop artists as outkast and the roots, which he described as \"a quiet groove that steadily increases in energy and intensity until an increasingly amped nas lets his lyrical rage boil over like a final fantasy fighter smacked once too often.\" according to nick butler, the song\\'s structure \"slowly build[s] up from a simple \\'in the air tonight\\' sample toward the full production ... like hearing two mini hip-hop versions of \\'stairway to heaven\\', before nas flips the script for the third verse and does the same thing in reverse.\" according to juon, the final verse has a reversal of this formula, in which nas \"goes from amped up to soft-spoken, drawing you even closer into his rap.\" \"one mic\" begins with a slow, deliberate flow and beat. music critic brett berliner wrote \"\\'one mic\\' starts out with a slow beat reminiscent of a crappy r&b song. throughout the song, nas\\' lazy flow turns into an angry rant over a fast paced beat, and finally a siren.\" lyrics and themes the lyrics of \"one mic\" discuss nas\\'s desire for a simple life (\"only if i had one gun, one girl, and one crib/one god to show me how to do things his son did\") and obstacles that prevent it (\"[if] one ni ga front, my face on the front page\"), and a lifestyle in which nas proclaims \"all i need is one mic - fuck the cars, the jewelry\". it has been noted by music writers for its political consciousness and dystopian themes. keith harris of city pages described the lyrical structure of \"one mic\" as \"urban claustrophobia distilled and digitized, with nas\\'s reportorial eye zooming in on a detail, then pulling back to a panoramic overview.\" music critic cynthia fuchs described the song\\'s lyrical scheme as \"building slowly to a crescendo of declaration and rage, then coming back, to seek a way to make a difference, with that precious one mic.\" in an interview for rolling stone, nas discussed the theme of the song, stating \"\\'one mic\\' is just about the power. it\\'s almost like hip hop is dead in its infant stages, saying how much this is a blessing to be out here, speaking about what\\'s happening in my neighborhood, having the whole world understand and relate.\" he also referred to commentator bill o\\'reilly\\'s criticism of \"shoot \\'em up\", a song from nas\\'s fourth album nastradamus (1999), as he stated \"if i didn\\'t have a microphone, i could never talk about \\'shoot \\'em up\\', and i was talking about queens, new york, being shot up. what do i have to do to get somebody to turn around and hear what i\\'m saying and take it serious? i\\'m not here just to be in your face talking nonsense, we\\'re talking about reality. for him to be upset or people like him to be upset is insane to me. it just shows how ignorant people are.\" in the interview, nas continued to discuss his inspiration and the song\\'s lyrical theme, stating: in the song, nas also asks god to forgive him for his sins. in the hip hop book beats, rhymes & life (2007), music writer ytasha womack compared nas\\'s lyrics on \"one mic\" to the work of rapper tupac shakur, analyzing it as a song with strong religious, christian overtones and lyrical themes. womack wrote that \"nas\\'s references ultimately humanized jesus, with attempts to show direct parallels between our quest and that of the wayshower.\" womack concluded with analyzing the incorporation of religious themes by nas in his composition, stating \"nas clung to spiritual questioning, expressing a desire to be like the early mystics, in order to possess their knowledge and powers. while he expresses that he has the potential of the greats, in \\'one mic\\' he asks god to show him how to do things his son did. nas intertwined his day-to-day life and decisions with the pressures felt by jesus and others, doing so almost as a means to somehow transfer their spiritual gifts to himself.\" release and reception when \"one mic\" was released as a single, it entered the billboard hot 100 at number 79 on april 20, 2002, ultimately peaking at number 43. on june 8, it debuted on the hot rap tracks chart at number 9, before eventually reaching number 7. the single also peaked on the hot rap singles at number 23, the rhythmic top 40 at number 32, and the hot r&b/hip-hop singles & tracks at number 14. a remix of \"one mic\", featuring a sample of mtume\\'s \"juicy fruit\" (1983), was later released on the remix album from illmatic to stillmatic: the remixes (2002). \"one mic\" was well received by critics, some of whom hailed it as a \"classic\". marc l. hill from popmatters cited it as stillmatics \"standout track\", calling nas \"our magnificently human rap god.\" exclaim! magazine\\'s del f. cowie described \"one mic\" as the album\\'s \"centrepiece epic\", while butler cited \"one mic\" as \"the best rap song of this decade\". writing for sputnikmusic, he said the song \"blew me away on first listen, and it\\'s still having the same effect now. not many rap songs can send chills up my spine. this is one of them.\" brett berliner from stylus magazine was particularly favorable of the song\\'s use of a siren, as he called the concept \"truly incredible, and one of the best ideas for a song i\\'ve ever heard in my life.\" steven potter of the journal sentinel called the song a \"testament to the lyrical skill only the best emcees possess.\" yahoo! music\\'s james poletti felt it was \"some of the best hip-hop recorded\" in 2002. kathryn mcguire from rolling stone was more critical, writing that \"the hyperbolic urgency of \\'one mic\\' feels staged.\" in retrospect, ign\\'s jon robinson viewed \"one mic\" as a comeback for nas, writing that it \"proved that he was still not only one of the dopest mcs in the world, but possibly the most gifted writer of the rap community.\" according to juon, the song signalled a return for nas to his early musical roots, stating \"you know that the rapper we all once called nasty nas has truly returned.\" in 2005, \"one mic\" was ranked number 54 on about.com\\'s list of the 100 greatest rap songs. music video a music video for \"one mic\" was directed by chris robinson and released on december 17, 2001, receiving heavy rotation on mtv, and 2002 mtv video music award nominations for best rap video and video of the year. robinson said in an interview with mtv that he wanted to feature references to the 1976 soweto uprising in a music video, ultimately persuading nas to include it in the video for the song. after the september 11, 2001 attacks, the video\\'s production ran into difficulties due to the restrictions on international travel. the scene in the video of the riots was instead filmed in los angeles with participants from a local inner-city baseball team playing the rioters. the scene of the rock being thrown in the direction of the camera was taken over 10 times (the actor \"had a bit of a curve on his throwing arm,\" according to robinson) before post-production work managed to complete the desired effect. robinson also told his director of photography to open and close the shutters of the camera in the apartment scene, creating an effect of blurred streaks of light. the video begins with a montage of scenes from inner-city areas of new york city, followed by a camera shot of an apartment window in which a light has just been turned on. the video then centralizes upon a view of nas reflectively rapping with a single microphone in a bare apartment room. while nas is rapping, the video switches to a scene of a routine police stop of four suspects which quickly escalates to an on-foot chase of the suspects by police as a surprised elder bystander \"fiend drops his heineken\" onto the asphalt. the suspects and the police dramatically part around nas, who is rapping in the middle of the street, as they continue the chase around a corner. as nas shouts \"the time is now!\", the scene cuts back to nas rapping in the barren apartment room with the microphone. the video transitions to a scene in soweto at the beginning of the 1976 uprising, in which a protester rallies a crowd of residents against the government while baton-wielding black and white soldiers of the sadf prepare for the impending crackdown on the protesters. gradually, the scene escalates to violence, with the impetus being a rock thrown in the direction of the camera. soon, the two sides clash on the dirt road, and nas pauses to a steady iteration of \"one mic\" while standing contrastedly in the middle of the ongoing violence, the scene ending with the silent scream (symbolized by a descending piano) of a little bystanding soweto girl as the scene cuts back to nas, in the apartment room, kicking the chair and launching headfirst into a full-blown litany. the soweto scene is interpolated with various scenes of young people listening and lip-syncing the lyrics, including a teenager wearing headphones in an apartment bedroom beside her younger sister, a group of latino men sitting in a car and a young, angry los angeles county prisoner behind bars. gradually, as the camera overlays a view of nas upon the forward-moving shot of a street, the video then calms down alongside the descending tone of the song, the facial determination of nas and other participants in the video remaining visible as the video draws to a close with the light in the apartment window turning off. track listing a-side \"one mic\" (explicit) (4:28) \"one mic\" (clean) (4:32) b-side \"one mic\" (instrumental) (4:36) \"2nd childhood\" (explicit) (3:51) produced by dj

       " 'lucien falize (paris 4 august 1839 - paris 4 september 1897) was a french jeweller and writer in france who was responsible for pioneering and driving the art nouveau movement with his firm, falize. he is known for his breathtaking and innovative designs for both public and private sales. early years lucien was a serious and diligent child who planned to attend the ecole centrale des arts et manufactures before his father, alexis, announced he was to become a future partner in his relatively young firm, falize. in 1856, lucien began an apprenticeship with his father, where he quickly learnt enough to supervise the design and manufacture of the pieces created in the workshop. his studies continued quickly, as lucien found his passion, and in 1869 at the exhibition held by the union centrale des beaux arts appliqués à l\\'industrie, he was awarded a first class medal as a coopérateur. two years later, at the age of 32, he was made a full partner and took over the firm in 1876. marriage and children the same year he was made a partner, lucien married louise clémentine poulard (1850-1914), with whom he had three sons: andré alexis eugène (1872-1936), jean henri lucien (1874-1948), and pierre isidore (1875-1953). although there is little evidence of tenderness and passion between lucien and clémentine - it is thought his parents instigated the match - he was a devoted father, designing and making individual silver watches for each of his children\\'s first communion. artistic career lucien falize was heavily influenced by his visits to london in 1861 and 1862, where he went to the national gallery, westminster abbey, and the crystal palace. he was struck by the chinese, indian, assyrian, and egyptian exhibits, and at the international exhibition he was impressed by the oriental lacquers, enamels, bronzes, prints, and earthenware taken from the collection of sir rutherford alcock. due to his ties to the firm, falize was unable to travel to japan, but his passion for the east began to manifest through his designs. pendants, bracelets, necklaces, and brooches with a distinct oriental effect began to emerge. these were enamelled and filled with bold, opaque colours with delicate scenes of nature and animals. lucien also visited the campana collection at the louvre, where he viewed a number of items, being influenced by the treasure trove of medieval, renaissance, assyrian, egyptian, and byzantine objects. until his death by a stroke in 1897, lucien continued to create breathtaking designs for public sale and private commissions. he was determined to make the jewellery house falize a commercial success, collaborating with other established designers like germain bapst, with whom he was partnered from 1880 to 1892. he was a prolific writer and reviewer and often published under his pseudonym, ‘monsieur josse\\' in the decorative arts journals of the day. lucien falize was also deeply involved in the union centrale throughout his career. he firmly believed in the importance of providing proper training to future designers, and he submitted plans for technical exhibitions and donated working prototypes of chatelaines and electrotypes of bracelets. lucien also entered his firm into a number of competitions and expositions universelles and was awarded countless honours and honorary positions throughout his career. often frustrated by the need to be a commercial success as well as a critical one, lucien said in a letter to his son andré in april 1896 \"a big firm cannot survive on works of art alone.\" his friend, jeweller and collector henri vever, said about lucien: how he would have loved to have lived…at the time of the medici, freed from heavy commercial burdens and only preoccupied by the creation of beautiful works. exhibitions and awards 1869: union centrale des beaux arts appliqués à l\\'industrie awarded a first class medal as a coopérateur 1876: union centrale des beaux arts appliqués à l\\'industrie as he was a jury member and official reporter, lucien was excluded from the awards 1877: amsterdam exhibition represented france with alfred darcel 1878: exposition universelle, paris awarded a grand prix;

       " 'alpena combat readiness training center is a michigan air national guard training facility. it is located west-northwest of alpena, michigan. overview the alpena crtc is a year-round training facility. it provides premier support, facilities, instruction and airspace to department of defense, department of homeland security, coalition and emergency responders to meet the mission requirements of combatant commanders and civil authorities. it is one of four combat readiness training centers in the united states. (the others are at volk field in wisconsin; gulfport, mississippi; and savannah, georgia.) the alpena crtc boasts the largest airspace east of the mississippi river, has 147,000 acres available for ground maneuver units, and trains over 20,000 joint and coalition personnel annually. the alpena crtc is the second organization in the air national guard to be certified as a joint national training center. the base has three jte\\'s, offers jtac training, and operates a jtac 4m dome simulator. the alpena county regional airport is a shared use airport between the alpena crtc and the alpena county, allowing for both civilian aircraft operations and military aircraft operations. mission statement \"our mission at the alpena combat readiness training center (crtc) is to provide premiere support, facilities, instruction, and airspace to the department of defense, department of homeland security, coalition forces, and emergency responders in order to meet the mission requirements of combatant commanders and civil authorities.\" history alpena combat readiness training center (crtc), formerly named phelps collins field and the phelps collins air national guard base, has a long interesting history beginning in the early 20th century. before that date, the area had a reputation for yielding blueberries in abundance to local indians and early settlers in the area. in the early 20th century, the area was known as the \"seven mile plains\" named because the flat open area stretching from the seven mile dam to m-32. during the early part of the 20th century, flying machines began to appear in the sky over most of the country including the alpena area. it didn\\'t take long for the early aeronautical risk takers to realize the flat open area was just what they needed to land and take off with their aircraft known as jennies. the landing area was a bit rough going, but so was the practice of flying in general during those early years. around the same time, local developers and land owners realized the potential of the flat area and foresaw the need for a landing strip as a result of the onset of air travel. thus the idea of an airport was born. harry fletcher and his brother philip (nephews of alan m. fletcher, founder of fletcher paper co.) began negotiations along with robert scott (then president of scott engineering) and james mcquarrie, who later sat on the county board\\'s airport committee. these individuals were fundamental in developing the plan and getting the state on board. the tract of 80 acres, previously surveyed by the army corps of engineers, was donated by harry and phillip. several other 40 acres plots donated by alpena power company set the proposed plan into action. during that same time, works progress administration (wpa) crews were working on projects around the country. they were pressed into service to begin the clearing of the underbrush and leveling out the land in preparation for the first landing area, which would later become the main part of the runway now in existence. on 31 august 1931, the airport was formally dedicated as captain phelps collins field in honor of alpena\\'s world war i hero, who in may 1917 volunteered to the french air service and fought with the celebrated french escadrille 103. on 7 january 1918, he transferred to the famed american 103d aero squadron, a successor to lafayette escadrille, and died while defending the airspace over paris on 12 march 1918. governor wilber m. brucker flew in to formally accept the airport and it became michigan\\'s first state owned airport. phelps had spent a lot of time in alpena as a youth shortly before he became interested in flying. there is a monument in france honoring the escadrille and his name appears on it. construction of the first hangar, a 40x90 foot structure built of cobblestone, began in 1935 and was completed in 1937. it could accommodate four average size aircraft of the era. the 1st pursuit group out of selfridge field practiced flying maneuvers and gunnery training near oscoda, michigan. when they became aware of the facility at alpena, they were eager to try it out. by the late 1930s, they began to use the airfield, housing their personnel in tents at the alpena county fairgrounds. this marked the beginning of military personnel using the site for training maneuvers as they still do today. in 1940, 400-500 selfridge men trained at phelps collins with a complement of 35 seversky p-35\\'s. with world war ii looming on the horizon the training tempo increased. the next year they brought p-40 warhawks and the first p-38\\'s lockheed lightning fighters. world war ii as a result of world war ii, the demand for training facilities became crucial and so the field was taken over by the war assets administration. the rough landing strip was replaced by a military airfield, with construction beginning on 29 july 1942. when completed, alpena army airfield consisted of three hard-surfaced concrete runways (5000x150 (01/19), 5030x150 (70/250), and 5030x150 (16/34). improvements included: housing for 2,000 personnel, two mess halls, operation buildings, a hospital and three runways over a mile long and 150 feet wide. actual construction began in 1942. this was a big project for alpena. by this time the total acreage of the base had increased to 2,500 acres. it was activated on 19 april 1943. the planned use of the base, along with training military personnel, was to provide air defense for the soo locks. controlled by the 4250th army air force base unit. the airfield was initially assigned to air transport command as a training base for long range transport pilots. in addition, the base was also tasked with certifying and training a pool of new pilots resulting from the p-47 thunderbolt modifications for staging out aircraft to overseas bases. it operated two sub-bases, one being kinross army airfield, which later became the strategic air command kincheloe air force base and raco army airfield, which later became an air defense command cim-10 bomarc surface-to-air missile site during the cold war. it was transferred to air technical service command in late 1944 when the atc training program was wound down. designated as alpena army air base, the facility was a maintenance and overhaul facility for b-24 liberator bombers produced by ford at its willow run, michigan aircraft manufacturing plant. aircraft would be sent to alpena for modifications prior to their deployment to overseas combat units. postwar era in 1946, alpena army air base was declared surplus and turned over to the war assets administration for disposition. it became alpena county regional airport. many of the buildings constructed in 1942 were stripped down and auctioned off and the only buildings left standing were the hospital area and big hangar built in 1943. some of the barracks (which were very small) were sold off and moved. some were placed in neighborhoods on alpena\\'s north side and were converted into private residences. air defense command alpena air force station (adc id: m-105) was established in 1954 by the united states air force air defense command as one of a planned deployment of forty-four mobile radar stations to support the permanent adc radar network in the united states sited around the perimeter of the country. this deployment was projected to be operational by mid-1952. funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. exercising a right of return to the facility, adc constructed the radar station on the northwest corner of the airport on the grounds of the former army air base ground station. this site became operational in december 1954 when the 677th aircraft control and warning squadron was moved to the new station from willow run air force station, michigan. beneficial occupancy was achieved at this phase i mobile radar site in late 1954. operations began in 1956, with an an/tps-1d radar, and initially the station functioned as a ground-control intercept (gci) and warning station. as a gci station, the squadron\\'s role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit\\'s radar scopes. budget cuts forced the station to close in 1957. it was then replaced by an unmanned gap-filler radar site, designated p-34e with an an/fps-18 radar, located on the southwest side of the airport. it was operated as such by the 752d radar squadron at empire afs, michigan from june 1960 until june 1968. today, a few buildings remain of the adc radar station, and the fps-18 support building remains of the gap filler site. air national guard use by january 1952, plans were in place to have joint use with the civilian airport. the facility would be instated as an ang permanent field training site (pfts). once the ang took over the site, they completed another round of construction projects totaling $2.5m dollars. sixty-two concrete block buildings were built including two dining facilities and barracks to house 2,000 men. the north-south runway was extended to 8,000 feet. most of the day-to-day operations were performed by the alpena county road commission still occupying a few building on the base. during the 1960s, the runway taxiways were extended and an air traffic control tower was added. also during that decade, the air defense command detachment from wurtsmith afb, oscoda michigan, had 60 persons permanently stationed here in alpena until 1972/73 at which time their unit was discontinued. the original military personnel assigned in 1953 totaled seven individuals and an additional two military and two federal civil service personnel were added the following year. the next major personnel change was in 1979 when the military personnel had their status changed from federal civil service technicians to active guard reservists (agr). about that time the civilians employed on the base became michigan state civil servants. in early 1960s, the grayling air-to-ground gunnery range negotiations began and early during the decade the range was constructed on 1,900 acres near grayling, michigan. soon after, aircraft could be seen using the site to fly sorties for aircraft gunnery and bombing exercises. this added asset increased the usage and value of the base immensely. units from all over the united states come annually to train, with air national guardsman totaling in the tens of thousands. in 1991, the site was renamed the alpena combat readiness training center (crtc). this new title was more in line with the base mission of \"combat training\". with the closing of wurtsmith afb in 1993, the need for radar approach and control was assigned to the crtc. equipment and personnel to operate it were added to the facility. the mission of the crtc was increased with the additional tasking of running an ang medical readiness training school. the schoolhouse was designed to train ang medical units for field operations. both of these programs added personnel to the workforce and the number of employees, military and civilian, was over 100 persons. construction in the early 1990s was ongoing, with a major emphasis on upgrading the 1950s barracks and latrines to current standards. thus a $3.8 million dormitory upgrade project begun and office buildings and officer quarters were all remodeled. during the period, under the command of col thomas g. cutler, the base created a long range plan including a new dining facility, fire station, operations facility, squadron operations (office) buildings, a convention center, a new facility at the grayling range and new dormitories. in 1991, another tasking was added to the mission when the air combat maneuver instrumentation (acmi) was instated. this system involves computerized communication between the aircraft and a computer satellite, providing full mission replay. with the addition of the fire training site and mout city in early 2000, the crtc hosts several fireman schools and numerous law enforcement training courses annually. although the crtc\\'s core mission is to train ang units, other military train here regularly. air force, army, navy seals marines and latvian and italian military have trained at the site. in recent years the crtc has opened its gate to numerous non-profit organizations. it is not uncommon to see canine training, emergency response training along with other training maneuvers running all at the same time. youth programs have expanded from the traditional civil air patrol cadets to include rotc, jrrotc, boy scouts of america/girl scouts of the usa, freedom academy students, michigan youth camp cadets. with the addition of 26 traditional guardsman positions in 2000, the number of total base personnel now is over 200 employees. agrs, traditional guardsman, michigan state civil service and contracted employees make up the group. military members come from all over the united states as well as local residents. prior to their assignment at the base, many personnel have served the army, air force, navy and marines. personnel have been called to give aid for local area flooding and deployed to hurricane katrina relief mission. many have volunteered and been deployed overseas in support of operations: desert storm, desert shield, iraqi freedom, joint forge, jump start, enduring freedom, northern watch, northern eagle and deep freeze. in 2013 manpower reductions took place with the closing of the medical readiness training site (mrts). this closing was part of a reduction in manpower directed by the usaf and ang. the closing of the mrts constituted a loss of 14 enlisted and two officers. the alpena crtc also faced manpower reductions in 2013. the vehicle maintenance shop has faced manpower reductions. the alpena crtc supply has been reduced to two members. the total loss of manpower in 2013 was over 25 enlisted members. since 2012, the alpena crtc has participated in one of the many department of defense\\'s multinational exercises called exercise northern strike. this exercise is one of the largest reserve component exercises designed to ensure members of the united states military, as well as other nation\\'s military\\'s train together to accomplish mission essential tasks and training for preparation of the future wartime environment with future adversaries. this exercise is designed to replicate a modern-wartime environment, utilizing aerial live-fire ranges to simulate close air support, as well as other mission essential tasks such as emergency response and testing air mobility capabilities. in 2017, captain brett devries, assigned to 107th fighter squadron in the michigan air national guard, crash landed an a-10 at the alpena regional county airport after the canopy of the aircraft had been removed and the landing gear would not extend down. northern strike 2021 exercise the alpena crtc hosted the arizona air national guard\\'s mq-9 reaper, an unmanned aircraft system (uas) that is utilized for aerial reconnaissance, close air support, and aerial precision strikes. during northern strike exercise the united states air force tested the capabilities of an upcoming technology called the \\'ground based detect and avoid system (gbdaa) at the alpena crtc. in 2021, for the first time in united states history the united states air force had conducted the operation of landing an aircraft on a us highway. this operation was conducted at the alpena crtc to show united states adversaries that the united states air force has the capability to land on highways and continue to be an effective fighting force as long as there are roads to land on. this proof of concept was intended to prove if the us military could operate at any location, anytime. the us air force, and michigan air national guard landed four a-10 thunderbolt ii\\'s assigned to the 354th fighter squadron, and the michigan air national guard\\'s 127th wing. an additional two c-146 wolfhounds, assigned to the air force special operations command also participated in this highway landing operation. in 2021, the alpena crtc participated in an air mobility command and hosted exercise mobility guardian, an exercise where the united states air force tests its agile combat employment (ace) capabilities, as well as its rapid global mobility capabilities with 18 air mobility aircraft at six different military locations. this exercise was designed to test the capabilities the united states air force has when it comes to the movement of personnel and equipment in high-stress combat rich environments. furthermore, this exercise tested the us military\\'s capabilities in a combat environment to refuel and rearm aircraft. additionally, a contingency location team (clt) and an air force special tactics team simulated an airfield seizure at the alpena crtc further proving the us military\\'s agile combat employment capabilities. exercise mobility guardian was conducted in preparation for a potential wartime environment with a developed nation or adversary. the winter strike 2022 exercise at grayling range, attached to the alpena crtc, was a multinational joint exercise between the michigan air national guard and the latvian military during the winter of 2021. winter strike exercise provides training for visiting units to acclimate to the demanding winter weather and to maintain wartime readiness regardless of the climate. see also united states general

artificial-intelligence-devised encryption system in october 2016, google brain designed an experiment to determine that neural networks are capable of learning secure symmetric encryption. in this experiment, three neural networks were created: alice, bob and eve. adhering to the idea of a generative adversarial network (gan), the goal of the experiment was for alice to send an encrypted message to bob that bob could decrypt, but the adversary, eve, could not. alice and bob maintained an advantage over eve, in that they shared a key used for encryption and decryption. in doing so, google brain demonstrated the capability of neural networks to learn secure encryption. image enhancement in february 2017, google brain determined a probabilistic method for converting pictures with 8x8 resolution to a resolution of 32x32. the method built upon an already existing probabilistic model called pixelcnn to generate pixel translations. the proposed software utilizes two neural networks to make approximations for the pixel makeup of translated images. the first network, known as the \"conditioning network,\" downsizes high-resolution images to 8x8 and attempts to create mappings from the original 8x8 image to these higher-resolution ones. the other network, known as the \"prior network,\" uses the mappings from the previous network to add more detail to the original image. the resulting translated image is not the same image in higher resolution, but rather a 32x32 resolution estimation based on other existing high-resolution images. google brain\\'s results indicate the possibility for neural networks to enhance images. google translate the google brain team contributed to the google translate project by employing a new deep learning system that combines artificial neural networks with vast databases of multilingual texts. in september 2016, google neural machine translation (gnmt) was launched, an end-to-end learning framework, able to learn from a large number of examples. previously, google translate\\'s phrase-based machine translation (pbmt) approach would statistically analyze word by word and try to match corresponding words in other languages without considering the surrounding phrases in the sentence. but rather than choosing a replacement for each individual word in the desired language, gnmt evaluates word segments in the context of the rest of the sentence to choose more accurate replacements. compared to older pbmt models, the gnmt model scored a 24% improvement in similarity to human translation, with a 60% reduction in errors. the gnmt has also shown significant improvement for notoriously difficult translations, like chinese to english. while the introduction of the gnmt has increased the quality of google translate\\'s translations for the pilot languages, it was very difficult to create such improvements for all of its 103 languages. addressing this problem, the google brain team was able to develop a multilingual gnmt system, which extended the previous one by enabling translations between multiple languages. furthermore, it allows for zero-shot translations, which are translations between two languages that the system has never explicitly seen before. google announced that google translate can now also translate without transcribing, using neural networks. this means that it is possible to translate speech in one language directly into text in another language, without first transcribing it to text. according to the researchers at google brain, this intermediate step can be avoided using neural networks. in order for the system to learn this, they exposed it to many hours of spanish audio together with the corresponding english text. the different layers of neural networks, replicating the human brain, were able to link the corresponding parts and subsequently manipulate the audio waveform until it was transformed to english text. another drawback of the gnmt model is that it causes the time of translation to increase exponentially with the number of words in the sentence. this caused the google brain team to add 2000 more processors to ensure the new translation process would still be fast and reliable. robotics aiming to improve traditional robotics control algorithms where new skills of a robot need to be hand-programmed, robotics researchers at google brain are developing machine learning techniques to allow robots to learn new skills on their own. they also attempt to develop ways for information sharing between robots so that robots can learn from each other during their learning process, also known as cloud robotics. as a result, google has launched the google cloud robotics platform for developers in 2019, an effort to combine robotics, ai, and the cloud to enable efficient robotic automation through cloud-connected collaborative robots. robotics research at google brain has focused mostly on improving and applying deep learning algorithms to enable robots to complete tasks by learning from experience, simulation, human demonstrations, and/or visual representations. for example, google brain researchers showed that robots can learn to pick and throw rigid objects into selected boxes by experimenting in an environment without being pre-programmed to do so. in another research, researchers trained robots to learn behaviors such as pouring liquid from a cup; robots learned from videos of human demonstrations recorded from multiple viewpoints. google brain researchers have collaborated with other companies and academic institutions on robotics research. in 2016, the google brain team collaborated with researchers at x in a research on learning hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping. their method allowed real-time robot control for grasping novel objects with self-correction. in 2020, researchers from google brain, intel ai lab, and uc berkeley created an ai model for robots to learn surgery-related tasks such as suturing from training with surgery videos. interactive speaker recognition with reinforcement learning in 2020, google brain team and university of lille presented a model for automatic speaker recognition which they called interactive speaker recognition. the isr module recognizes a speaker from a given list of speakers only by requesting a few user specific words. the model can be altered to choose speech segments in the context of text-to-speech training. it can also prevent malicious voice generators from accessing the data. tensorflow tensorflow is an open source software library powered by google brain that allows anyone to utilize machine learning by providing the tools to train one\\'s own neural network. the tool has been used by farmers to reduce the amount of manual labor required to sort their yield, by training it with a data set of human-sorted images. magenta magenta is a project that uses google brain to create new information in the form of art and music rather than classify and sort existing data. tensorflow was updated with a suite of tools for users to guide the neural network to create images and music. however, the team from valdosta state university found that the ai struggles to perfectly replicate human intention in artistry, similar to the issues faced in translation. medical applications the image sorting capabilities of google brain have been used to help detect certain medical conditions by seeking out patterns that human doctors may not notice to provide an earlier diagnosis. during screening for breast cancer, this method was found to have one quarter the false positive rate of human pathologists, who require more time to look over each photo and cannot spend their entire focus on this one task. due to the neural network\\'s very specific training for a single task, it cannot identify other afflictions present in a photo that a human could easily spot. text-to-image model google brain announced in 2022 that it created two different types of text-to-image models called imagen and parti that compete with openai\\'s dall-e. later in 2022, the project was extended to text-to-video. other google products the google brain projects\\' technology is currently used in various other google products such as the android operating system\\'s speech recognition system, photo search for google photos, smart

kurzweil and andrew ng, and focus on explanations of the project\\'s goals and applications. controversies in december 2020, ai ethicist timnit gebru left google. while the exact nature of her quitting or being fired is disputed, the cause of the departure was her refusal to retract a paper entitled \"on the dangers of stochastic parrots: can language models be too big?\" this paper explored potential risks of the growth of ai such as google brain, including environmental impact, biases in training data, and the ability to deceive the public. the request to retract the paper was made by megan kacholia, vice president of google brain. as of april 2021, nearly 7000 current or former google employees and industry supporters have signed an open letter accusing google of \"research censorship\" and condemning gebru\\'s treatment at the company. in february 2021, google fired one of the leaders of the company\\'s ai ethics team, margaret mitchell. the company\\'s statement alleged that mitchell had broken company policy by using automated tools to find support for gebru. in the same month, engineers outside the ethics team began to quit, citing the termination of gebru as their reason for leaving. in april 2021, google brain co-founder samy bengio announced his resignation from the company. despite being gebru\\'s manager, bengio was not notified before her termination, and he posted online in support of both her and mitchell. while bengio\\'s announcement focused on personal growth as his reason for leaving, anonymous sources indicated to reuters that the turmoil within the ai ethics team played a role in his considerations. in march 2022, google fired ai researcher satrajit chatterjee after he questioned the findings of a paper published in

       " 'the minore mafia clan was a historical sicilian mafia clan originating from the city of castellammare del golfo on sicily\\'s west coast. it was probably founded sometime at the start of the 20th century, it later came to control the city of trapani and held considerable influence throughout the entire province, and also in palermo and catania. they historically maintained good relations with the buccellato mafia clan, which also hailed from castellammare del golfo. history and notable members the first recorded mention of the clan is from the 1910s, when salvatore minore, nicknamed \"don totò\", was named as a powerful mafioso in the city. minore\\'s sister elisabetta married salvatore maranzano, who would later emigrate to the united states and become an important figure within the american mafia. the best known members of the clan, however, are the minore brothers and cousins who took control of the city of trapani in the 1950s, taking over from andrea fazio. the boss thus became antonio salvatore minore, commonly known as totò minore, who controlled the city and held great sway over the province together with his brothers giovanni, calogero, giuseppe and giacomo. totò minore, who was already well known to law enforcement and was banished as part of the \"soggiorno obbligato\" measure to the island of ustica in 1948 for five years. calogero minore was considered the peacemaker of the family for his ability to mediate disputes in the region, and was tied to mazara boss leonardo bonafede. the minore clan went on to form a very strong alliance with the buccellato mafia clan, which like the minores hailed from castellammare del golfo, and eventually came to control that city. totò minore was one of the mafiosi present at the 1957 palermo mafia summit with american crime boss joe bonanno. in 1966, totò minore emigrated to the united states and linked up to the gambino family, opening up a series of pizzerias that were used as a front for narcotics trafficking. he also traveled to libya, brazil (where he owned a hotel) and argentina (once with future mafia pentito tommaso buscetta), and was involved in a large money laundering operation in mainland italy and in the province of trapani itself. totò minore developed very close ties to the province of catania. in 1960, he was the godfather at the baptism of the son of giuseppe calderone, the mafia boss of catania. minore was also in business relations with carmelo costanzo, dubbed one of \"the four horsemen of the mafia apocalypse\" by journalist pippo fava. according to pentito antonino calderone, minore was a family friend of carmelo costanzo and his other relatives, and some \"men of honor\" who were forced to leave the province of trapani due to police attention were employed at the costanzo facilities under minore\\'s direction. both totò and calogero minore came to own two hundred hectares of land each near trapani, which were frequently used for mafia summits and hiding fugitives, and they owned many businesses in and around the city, including tourism facilities, vehicle dealerships, cooperatives, and most importantly the city\\'s banks. both the minore and buccellato clan developed a fierce rivalry with the rimi mafia clan over the course of the 1970s, and in turn with the mafia family of cinisi headed by gaetano badalamenti, who was related to the rimis by marriage. the minore and buccellato clans resented the rimis\\' strong links with the palermitan families, and when badalamenti was in power he even warned minore against going to the province of palermo under the threat of death. the emerging corleonesi mafia clan at this point backed the minores and buccellatos against the rimis and badalamentis in their quest to isolate the palermo families. but while such threats of violence and other acts of hostility abounded, the rivalry never developed into a proper war. the minore clan was involved in a controversy in the late 1970s with the prosecutor of trapani, giangiacomo ciaccio montalto. montalto was investigating mafia activities in the city and province and scrutinized the minore\\'s many illegal dealings, including several kidnappings in the area such as the fake kidnapping of the businessman rodittis and the kidnapping and murder of luigi corleo, the father-in-law of nino salvo. montalto even ordered an exhumation of the elder brother giovanni, who had died of natural causes, something which caused great resentment against him by the clan. montalto issued an arrest warrant for totò minore in 1979 for weapons trafficking, and from then on the boss of trapani and his brother lived as fugitives. ciaccio montalto would eventually be murdered in january 1983, and for a long time police suspected totò minore of being the organizer, although it later came to light that the murder was carried out by the corleonesi and saw no involvement from the minore clan. decline the minore and buccellato clans had been close to the corleonesi clan of totò riina prior to the outbreak of the second mafia war. nevertheless, as the war began, riina saw them as unreliable due to their insistence on being neutral and most importantly, he was eager to weaken the two clans to reward his main allies in the province: francesco messina denaro from castelvetrano, mariano agate from mazara del vallo and vincenzo virga from trapani. on 20 november 1982, totò minore, nicolò miceli, martino buccellato from castellammare del golfo and vincenzo palazzolo from cinisi were summoned to a meeting in palermo by the boss of partanna-mondello, rosario riccobono. there, on the orders of totò riina, the four were strangled and their bodies made to disappear, a practice colloquially known as lupara bianca. news of the massacre did not emerge in mainstream media until 1998, when calogero ganci, son of raffaele ganci and one of the killers of totò minore, confessed to police. underworld legend goes that totò minore\\'s severed head, on riina\\'s orders, was delivered to his relatives as a warning. ironically, this would be rosario riccobono\\'s last betrayal on behalf of the corleonesi, as the boss of partanna-mondello himself would be murdered in similar circumstances only ten days later, on 30 november. totò minore\\'s brother calogero remained a fugitive until 1986, when he was arrested while hiding in a house in trapani. he died of natural causes in 1998, before any of his trials had concluded. many other associates of the minores were either murdered or forced to step down during the war, and the clan lost all of the power it had accumulated over decades in sicily, as did the buccellatos and many other \"old guard\" mafia clans defeated by the corleonesi. references external links

       " 'in physics, a field is a physical quantity, represented by a scalar, vector, or tensor, that has a value for each point in space and time. for example, on a weather map, the surface temperature is described by assigning a number to each point on the map; the temperature can be considered at a certain point in time or over some interval of time, to study the dynamics of temperature change. a surface wind map, assigning an arrow to each point on a map that describes the wind speed and direction at that point, is an example of a vector field, i.e. a 1-dimensional (rank-1) tensor field. field theories, mathematical descriptions of how field values change in space and time, are ubiquitous in physics. for instance, the electric field is another rank-1 tensor field, while electrodynamics can be formulated in terms of two interacting vector fields at each point in spacetime, or as a single-rank 2-tensor field. in the modern framework of the quantum theory of fields, even without referring to a test particle, a field occupies space, contains energy, and its presence precludes a classical \"true vacuum\". this has led physicists to consider electromagnetic fields to be a physical entity, making the field concept a supporting paradigm of the edifice of modern physics. \"the fact that the electromagnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes it very real ... a particle makes a field, and a field acts on another particle, and the field has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum, just as particles can have.\" in practice, the strength of most fields diminishes with distance, eventually becoming undetectable. for instance the strength of many relevant classical fields, such as the gravitational field in newton\\'s theory of gravity or the electrostatic field in classical electromagnetism, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (i.e., they follow gauss\\'s law). a field can be classified as a scalar field, a vector field, a spinor field or a tensor field according to whether the represented physical quantity is a scalar, a vector, a spinor, or a tensor, respectively. a field has a consistent tensorial character wherever it is defined: i.e. a field cannot be a scalar field somewhere and a vector field somewhere else. for example, the newtonian gravitational field is a vector field: specifying its value at a point in spacetime requires three numbers, the components of the gravitational field vector at that point. moreover, within each category (scalar, vector, tensor), a field can be either a classical field or a quantum field, depending on whether it is characterized by numbers or quantum operators respectively. in this theory an equivalent representation of field is a field particle, for instance a boson. history to isaac newton, his law of universal gravitation simply expressed the gravitational force that acted between any pair of massive objects. when looking at the motion of many bodies all interacting with each other, such as the planets in the solar system, dealing with the force between each pair of bodies separately rapidly becomes computationally inconvenient. in the eighteenth century, a new quantity was devised to simplify the bookkeeping of all these gravitational forces. this quantity, the gravitational field, gave at each point in space the total gravitational acceleration which would be felt by a small object at that point. this did not change the physics in any way: it did not matter if all the gravitational forces on an object were calculated individually and then added together, or if all the contributions were first added together as a gravitational field and then applied to an object. the development of the independent concept of a field truly began in the nineteenth century with the development of the theory of electromagnetism. in the early stages, andré-marie ampère and charles-augustin de coulomb could manage with newton-style laws that expressed the forces between pairs of electric charges or electric currents. however, it became much more natural to take the field approach and express these laws in terms of electric and magnetic fields; in 1849 michael faraday became the first to coin the term \"field\". the independent nature of the field became more apparent with james clerk maxwell\\'s discovery that waves in these fields propagated at a finite speed. consequently, the forces on charges and currents no longer just depended on the positions and velocities of other charges and currents at the same time, but also on their positions and velocities in the past. maxwell, at first, did not adopt the modern concept of a field as a fundamental quantity that could independently exist. instead, he supposed that the electromagnetic field expressed the deformation of some underlying medium—the luminiferous aether—much like the tension in a rubber membrane. if that were the case, the observed velocity of the electromagnetic waves should depend upon the velocity of the observer with respect to the aether. despite much effort, no experimental evidence of such an effect was ever found; the situation was resolved by the introduction of the special theory of relativity by albert einstein in 1905. this theory changed the way the viewpoints of moving observers were related to each other. they became related to each other in such a way that velocity of electromagnetic waves in maxwell\\'s theory would be the same for all observers. by doing away with the need for a background medium, this development opened the way for physicists to start thinking about fields as truly independent entities. in the late 1920s, the new rules of quantum mechanics were first applied to the electromagnetic field. in 1927, paul dirac used quantum fields to successfully explain how the decay of an atom to a lower quantum state led to the spontaneous emission of a photon, the quantum of the electromagnetic field. this was soon followed by the realization (following the work of pascual jordan, eugene wigner, werner heisenberg, and wolfgang pauli) that all particles, including electrons and protons, could be understood as the quanta of some quantum field, elevating fields to the status of the most fundamental objects in nature. that said, john wheeler and richard feynman seriously considered newton\\'s pre-field concept of action at a distance (although they set it aside because of the ongoing utility of the field concept for research in general relativity and quantum electrodynamics). classical fields there are several examples of classical fields. classical field theories remain useful wherever quantum properties do not arise, and can be active areas of research. elasticity of materials, fluid dynamics and maxwell\\'s equations are cases in point. some of the simplest physical fields are vector force fields. historically, the first time that fields were taken seriously was with faraday\\'s lines of force when describing the electric field. the gravitational field was then similarly described. newtonian gravitation a classical field theory describing gravity is newtonian gravitation, which describes the gravitational force as a mutual interaction between two masses. any body with mass m is associated with a gravitational field g which describes its influence on other bodies with mass. the gravitational field of m at a point r in space corresponds to the ratio between force f that m exerts on a small or negligible test mass m located at r and the test mass itself: stipulating that m is much smaller than m ensures that the presence of m has a negligible influence on the behavior of m. according to newton\\'s law of universal gravitation, f(r) is given by where is a unit vector lying along the line joining m and m and pointing from m to m. therefore, the gravitational field of m is the experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal to an unprecedented level of accuracy leads to the identity that gravitational field strength is identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. this is the starting point of the equivalence principle, which leads to general relativity. because the gravitational force f is conservative, the gravitational field g can be rewritten in terms of the gradient of a scalar function, the gravitational potential φ(r): electromagnetism michael faraday first realized the importance of a field as a physical quantity, during his investigations into magnetism. he realized that electric and magnetic fields are not only fields of force which dictate the motion of particles, but also have an independent physical reality because they carry energy. these ideas eventually led to the creation, by james clerk maxwell, of the first unified field theory in physics with the introduction of equations for the electromagnetic field. the modern version of these equations is called maxwell\\'s equations. electrostatics a charged test particle with charge q experiences a force f based solely on its charge. we can similarly describe the electric field e so that . using this and coulomb\\'s law tells us that the electric field due to a single charged particle is the electric field is conservative, and hence can be described by a scalar potential, v(r): magnetostatics a steady current i flowing along a path ℓ will create a field b, that exerts a force on nearby moving charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. the force exerted by i on a nearby charge q with velocity v is where b(r) is the magnetic field, which is determined from i by the biot-savart law: the magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. however, it can be written in terms of a vector potential, a(r): electrodynamics in general, in the presence of both a charge density ρ(r, t) and current density j(r, t), there will be both an electric and a magnetic field, and both will vary in time. they are determined by maxwell\\'s equations, a set of differential equations which directly relate e and b to ρ and j. alternatively, one can describe the system in terms of its scalar and vector potentials v and a. a set of integral equations known as retarded potentials allow one to calculate v and a from ρ and j, and from there the electric and magnetic fields are determined via the relations at the end of the 19th century, the electromagnetic field was understood as a collection of two vector fields in space. nowadays, one recognizes this as a single antisymmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in spacetime. gravitation in general relativity einstein\\'s theory of gravity, called general relativity, is another example of a field theory. here the principal field is the metric tensor, a symmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in spacetime. this replaces newton\\'s law of universal gravitation. waves as fields waves can be constructed as physical fields, due to their finite propagation speed and causal nature when a simplified physical model of an isolated closed system is set . they are also subject to the inverse-square law. for electromagnetic waves, there are optical fields, and terms such as near- and far-field limits for diffraction. in practice though, the field theories of optics are superseded by the electromagnetic field theory of maxwell. quantum fields it is now believed that quantum mechanics should underlie all physical phenomena, so that a classical field theory should, at least in principle, permit a recasting in quantum mechanical terms; success yields the corresponding quantum field theory. for example, quantizing classical electrodynamics gives quantum electrodynamics. quantum electrodynamics is arguably the most successful scientific theory; experimental data confirm its predictions to a higher precision (to more significant digits) than any other theory. the two other fundamental quantum field theories are quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory. in quantum chromodynamics, the color field lines are coupled at short distances by gluons, which are polarized by the field and line up with it. this effect increases within a short distance (around 1 fm from the vicinity of the quarks) making the color force increase within a short distance, confining the quarks within hadrons. as the field lines are pulled together tightly by gluons, they do not \"bow\" outwards as much as an electric field between electric charges. these three quantum field theories can all be derived as special cases of the so-called standard model of particle physics. general relativity, the einsteinian field theory of gravity, has yet to be successfully quantized. however an extension, thermal field theory, deals with quantum field theory at finite temperatures, something seldom considered in quantum field theory. in brst theory one deals with odd fields, e.g. faddeev-popov ghosts. there are different descriptions of odd classical fields both on graded manifolds and supermanifolds. as above with classical fields, it is possible to approach their quantum counterparts from a purely mathematical view using similar techniques as before. the equations governing the quantum fields are in fact pdes (specifically, relativistic wave equations (rwes)). thus one can speak of yang-mills, dirac, klein-gordon and schrödinger fields as being solutions to their respective equations. a possible problem is that these rwes can deal with complicated mathematical objects with exotic algebraic properties (e.g. spinors are not tensors, so may need calculus for spinor fields), but these in theory can still be subjected to analytical methods given appropriate mathematical generalization. field theory field theory usually refers to a construction of the dynamics of a field, i.e., a specification of how a field changes with time or with respect to other independent physical variables on which the field depends. usually this is done by writing a lagrangian or a hamiltonian of the field, and treating it as a classical or quantum mechanical system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. the resulting field theories are referred to as classical or quantum field theories. the dynamics of a classical field are usually specified by the lagrangian density in terms of the field components; the dynamics can be obtained by using the action principle. it is possible to construct simple fields without any prior knowledge of physics using only mathematics from multivariable calculus, potential theory and partial differential equations (pdes). for example, scalar pdes might consider quantities such as amplitude, density and pressure fields for the wave equation and fluid dynamics; temperature/concentration fields for the heat/diffusion equations. outside of physics proper (e.g., radiometry and computer graphics), there are even light fields. all these previous examples are scalar fields. similarly for vectors, there are vector pdes for displacement, velocity and vorticity fields in (applied mathematical) fluid dynamics, but vector calculus may now be needed in addition, being calculus for vector fields (as are these three quantities, and those for vector pdes in general). more generally problems in continuum mechanics may involve for example, directional elasticity (from which comes the term tensor, derived from the latin word for stretch), complex fluid flows or anisotropic diffusion, which are framed as matrix-tensor pdes, and then require matrices or tensor fields, hence matrix or tensor calculus. the scalars (and hence the vectors, matrices and tensors) can be real or complex as both are fields in the abstract-algebraic/ring-theoretic sense. in a general setting, classical fields are described by sections of fiber bundles and their dynamics is formulated in the terms of jet manifolds (covariant classical field theory). in modern physics, the most often studied fields are those that model the four fundamental forces which one day may lead to the unified field theory. symmetries of fields a convenient way of classifying a field (classical or quantum) is by the symmetries it possesses. physical symmetries are usually of two types: spacetime symmetries fields are often classified by their behaviour under transformations of spacetime. the terms used in this classification are: scalar fields (such as temperature) whose values are given by a single variable at each point of space. this value does not change under transformations of space. vector fields (such as the magnitude and direction of the force at each point in a magnetic field) which are specified by attaching a vector to each point of space. the components of this vector transform between themselves contravariantly under rotations in space. similarly, a dual (or co-) vector field attaches a dual vector to each point of space, and the components of each dual vector transform covariantly. tensor fields, (such as the stress tensor of a crystal) specified by a tensor at each point of space. under rotations in space, the components of the tensor transform in a more general way which depends on the number of covariant indices and contravariant indices. spinor fields (such as the dirac spinor) arise in quantum field theory to describe particles with spin which transform like vectors except for one of their components; in other words, when one rotates a vector field 360 degrees around a specific axis, the vector field turns to itself; however, spinors would turn to their negatives in the same case. internal symmetries fields may have internal symmetries in addition to spacetime symmetries. in many situations, one needs fields which are a list of spacetime scalars: (φ1, φ2, ... φn). for example, in weather prediction these may be temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. in particle physics, the color symmetry of the interaction of quarks is an example of an internal symmetry, that of the strong interaction. other examples are isospin, weak isospin, strangeness and any other flavour symmetry. if there is a symmetry of the problem, not involving spacetime, under which these components transform into each other, then this set of symmetries is called an internal symmetry. one may also make a classification of the charges of the fields under internal symmetries. statistical field theory statistical field theory attempts to extend the field-theoretic paradigm toward many-body systems and statistical mechanics. as above, it can be approached by the usual infinite number of degrees of freedom argument. much like statistical mechanics has some overlap between quantum and classical mechanics, statistical field theory has links to both quantum and classical field theories, especially the former with which it shares many methods. one important example is mean field theory. continuous random fields classical fields as above, such as the electromagnetic field, are usually infinitely differentiable functions, but they are in any case almost always twice differentiable. in contrast, generalized functions are not continuous. when dealing carefully with classical fields at finite temperature, the mathematical methods of continuous random fields are used, because thermally fluctuating classical fields are nowhere differentiable. random fields are indexed sets of random variables; a continuous random field is a random field that has a set of functions as its index set. in particular, it is often mathematically convenient to take a continuous random field to have a schwartz space of functions as its index set, in which case the continuous random field is a tempered distribution. we can think about a continuous random field, in a (very) rough way, as an ordinary function that is almost everywhere, but such that when we take a weighted average of all the infinities over any finite region, we get a finite result. the infinities are not well-defined; but the finite values can be associated with the functions used as the weight functions to get the finite values, and that can be well-defined. we can define a continuous random field well enough as a linear map from a space of functions into the real numbers. see also conformal field theory covariant hamiltonian field theory field strength history of the

       " 'the lone star series (also known as the silver boot series) is a major league baseball (mlb) rivalry featuring texas\\' two major league franchises, the houston astros and texas rangers. it is an outgrowth of the \"natural rivalry\" established by mlb as part of interleague play as the rangers are a member of the american league (al) and the astros were a member of the national league (nl) until . during interleague play, the winner of the six-game series was awarded the silver boot, a tall display of a size 15 cowboy boot cast in silver, complete with a custom, handmade spur. if each team had won three games each for a tie, the declared winner was the team that scored the most runs over the course of the series. in , the astros joined the american league west with the rangers and changed their rivalry from an interleague to an intradivision contest. the rivalry, which was once dormant, has become far more heated in recent seasons. from 2013 to 2022 (excluding the shortened 2020 season), 19 games were played each season. beginning in 2023, the teams play each other 13 times a year. background the greater houston and dallas-fort worth metroplex (dfw) areas have been rivals in sports and other areas for many years. differences, not related to baseball, include the weather during the summer, population, cultural, and allegiance preferences between the different regions of texas. both greater houston and dfw have humid subtropical climates; however, dfw mostly has dry winds in the summer and sometimes icy conditions in the winter, with some frost at night, compared to greater houston\\'s severe relative humidity and minimal wind, except near the coast, and milder winter conditions. the metroplex is located inland in north texas while houston is in the face of the gulf of mexico in southeast texas. the city of dallas has the ninth largest population in the united states and third largest population in texas; the city of houston has the fourth largest population in the united states and largest population in texas. dfw is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the united states, while the greater houston area is the fifth largest. history the lone star series was the consequence of many things that happened to texas in the 1950s: population shift westward from metropolitan areas on the east coast, the space program, more modernized higher education, and the formation of the brief continental league resulting in expansion in major league baseball shortly thereafter. 1962: texas has its first major league team, the colt .45s prior to 1962, there were no major league baseball teams in texas until the houston colt .45\\'s of the national league. they played in colt stadium for the first three years of existence, fighting against hot and humid weather and outrageously large mosquitoes, which also had an effect on the fans. unbelievably, they did not play a sunday night baseball game at home until june 9, 1963, which was also the major leagues\\' first sunday night game. the astros, as they came to be with the new all-weathered harris county domed stadium, really did not have a strong rivalry with any team in the nl, except for the st. louis cardinals and later on the cincinnati reds and atlanta braves. during the planning of the second wave of expansion in the big leagues in 1968, the national league considered putting a new team in the dallas-fort worth area by an overwhelming majority of its owners. however, judge roy hofheinz did not want it to happen or allow it because he owned all the television and radio rights in texas for astros ballgames. the other owners were in favor, except hofheinz, of having a rivalry approaching the intensity of the dodgers-giants rivalry in the senior circuit. san diego and montreal were selected instead. the dallas-fort worth area had to wait four more years for a team to arrive when the senators (see below) moved to arlington, texas. it would be another 32 years before there was a meeting between the rangers and astros. 1972: washington senators move to arlington to become the rangers before they were the texas rangers, the team belonged to the beltway as the third version of the washington senators where they played mediocre baseball most of the time for the first 11 years of existence. they replaced the old washington senators who had moved to the minneapolis-saint paul area to become the minnesota twins in 1961. the new senators changed into the texas rangers in time for the 1972 season, and so a rivalry was born. (at one time, the kansas city athletics were interested in moving to the dallas/fort worth area in the early 1960s but were voted down, 9-1, by the other american league owners.) the astros have been in texas ten years longer than the rangers, but the senators/rangers franchise is one year older than the astros. they met, starting in 1992, at the end of spring training with the rangers winning 2-0 and claiming the very first silver boot. on april 1, 1993, nolan ryan returned to the astrodome as a member of the texas rangers in front of 53,657, the biggest crowd to see a big league game in texas up to that point. the rangers won the last two exhibition games, a 6-5 victory in arlington in 1999 and a 9-3 victory at houston in 2000, before the two teams met for the first time in regular season in 2001. 1996-2012: first official meetings and interleague play one year before their first official matchup in interleague play, both teams retired the number of hall of famer nolan ryan, who had successful runs with both teams. during the 1997 off-season, \"radical\" realignment plans were bandied around about possibly rearranging teams from one league to another, especially houston and texas. in order to cut down on traveling costs and align teams together based on geography, the mlb owners came up with many plans to put the astros and rangers in a more suitable placement together. however, the american league and national league would lose their respective identities in the process. (the only move was the brewers from the al central to the nl central.) one of the plans in 2000 even featured the texas rangers in a six-team al central, so that they would be with other teams in the central time zone, while the fledgling arizona diamondbacks would have had to leave the nl west for the al west to replace the rangers. during the 2005-06 off-season, the florida marlins were considering moving to san antonio, among other cities, due to the lack of funding for a new stadium. another professional baseball team in texas, whether by relocation or expansion, in either league would create greater rivalries, similar to the kind in the nba with the spurs, mavericks, and rockets, and possible realignment issues. the lone star series was not conceived until , four years after interleague play began. it was only logical to have the rangers and astros matched together since they are the only mlb teams representing texas. since both played in two different divisions (al west and nl central, respectively), major league baseball had to rectify the oversight even though interleague play would not be rotated from division to division on a yearly basis until 2002. there has only been one rainout in the history of the lone star series. a game scheduled for sunday june 30, 2002, at rangers ballpark in arlington was postponed due to rain and rescheduled for monday, september 2. the rangers won the last game of the year against the astros, 7-2, in front of a crowd of 24,468, but the astros won the silver boot regardless of the outcome of the game. on july 1, , rangers outfielder gary matthews jr. stole a home run from astro mike lamb (a former ranger) in what was considered one of the greatest catches of the decade according to mlb network. at that time according to lamb and mark teixeira, the rangers-astros \"rivalry\" was more for the fans in texas than like a bitter rivalry (e.g. windy city series). beginning in 2008, the lone star series saw for the first time two african-american managers go head-to-head against one another, the astros\\' cecil cooper and the rangers\\' ron washington. this situation lasted for two years. on february 6, 2008, nolan ryan became the rangers\\' team president after being the special assistant to general manager, scouting players, and holding pitching camps with the astros for the previous three seasons. on august 18, 2009, the rangers acquired iván rodríguez in a trade from the houston astros to help them down the stretch for the purpose of achieving their first playoff appearance in ten years. it was rodriguez\\'s second stint with texas. the team had a winning season but did not qualify for the postseason. on september 14, 2010, the astros\\' triple-a affiliate, the round rock express, announced that they would become the rangers\\' new minor league affiliate. this change left the astros without a triple-a team and the rangers\\' old triple-a team, the oklahoma city redhawks, without a parent club. on september 20, 2010, the astros made the redhawks their own affiliate. these changes went into effect for the 2011 season. 2013-present: astros join the american league major league baseball approved the sale of the astros on november 11, , to jim crane on the condition they join the american league west. the rangers, located in the central time zone, had many of their games start late in the pacific time zone due to the angels, athletics, and mariners all being located on the west coast. to help ease the rangers\\' schedule, commissioner bud selig required that the astros join the al west in , so both teams would have another division rival in relatively close geographical proximity to one another while ensuring that both the al west and the national league central both would have the same number of teams as the other divisions. the move\\'s consequence for the rest of the league resulted in all teams having to play interleague games year round due to the odd number of teams in each league. another consequence would be an increase in intensity of the lone star baseball rivalry. the astros and rangers played each other on opening day on march 31, 2013, with the astros winning convincingly at home. the next game, rangers pitcher yu darvish was one out away from a perfect game when marwin gonzález hit a single through darvish\\'s legs. on february 11, 2014, nolan ryan returned to the astros as an executive advisor to his son, reid, the president of business operations; general manager jeff luhnow; and owner jim crane. nolan ryan is also the only person to be named dhl hometown hero by two organizations (the rangers and the astros). in april 2015, a brawl started between rougned odor and hank conger, which started when odor, staring down the pitcher out of the batter\\'s box, exchanged words with conger when the catcher told him to get back. while the umpire quickly got in the middle of the two advancing toward each other, both teams soon swarmed close to each other, which included prince fielder (the batter scheduled to hit after odor), who pushed conger aside while having his bat with him. astros manager a. j. hinch grabbed prince fielder, while fielder shoved back. this was followed by rangers manager jeff bannister getting nose to nose with hinch; shouting and pointing aside, no punches were thrown and no ejections were issued. later in september, with both teams in contention for the playoffs, the astros and rangers faced each other in a pivotal series, with texas sweeping all four games. the rangers, who entered the series 1.5 games behind houston for the al west lead, ended the series leading the astros by 2.5 games. the rangers clinched the 2015 al west division title, while the astros entered the 2015 playoffs as a wild card team. the rangers marked the al west division title by taunting the astros with a parody of the astros\\' \"come and take it!\" campaign by proclaiming \"we came and took it!\" during a game at globe life park; the two teams would have met in the alcs had they each won their respective alds but both lost in game 5. in 2017, the rivalry between the astros and rangers continued to heat up. during a radio interview rangers manager jeff bannister was quoted as saying, \"all i know is they get to put houston on their chest. we get to put texas on ours.\" astros pitcher lance mccullers jr. fired back on twitter stating, \"it\\'s because nobody knows what arlington is.\" later in the 2017 season after hurricane harvey hit houston, controversy arose when the astros and rangers could not negotiate swapping series forcing the astros to play a series of home games against the rangers at the tampa bay rays\\' stadium (tropicana field) in florida. the rangers won the series 2-1 but lost the season series 7-12. the astros swept the rangers in the final three games of the series and outscored the rangers 42-8 in the final four games. the rangers did not make the 2017 playoffs, and the astros clinched their first world series championship, the first world series championship in the astros-rangers rivalry and the first world series title for the state of texas. when the astros played the opening day game in 2018 as defending world series champions, they did so in arlington, which they won 4-1. houston was victorious in both the 2018 and 2019 silver boot series as they won the al west both seasons, making three consecutive division titles for the club with 100 wins in each season. meanwhile, texas continued to rebuild and had losing seasons for the second and third year in a row. the astros made history at the expense of the rangers on june 15, 2022, when luis garcia and phil maton each pitched an immaculate inning for the astros at globe life field. it was the first instance in major league history of two immaculate innings being thrown on the same date and in the same game. garcia threw his in the second inning and maton in the seventh, and they both struck out the same trio of hitters—nathaniel lowe, ezequiel durán, and brad miller. the astro relied on excellent pitching throughout the year to win 106 regular-season games on their way to claiming a second world series championship, defeating the philadelphia phillies in six games. prior to the 2023 season, the rangers hired bruce bochy as manager; meanwhile, dusty baker served as manager of the astros. both men had previously led the san francisco giants, including when bochy led the giants to their 2010 world series defeat of the rangers, his first championship. in their long and distinguished managerial careers, baker and bochy also concurrently guided other teams as rivals in the national league since the 1990s, accumulating over 2,000 wins each. the two teams later became the beneficiary of the new york mets\\' fire sale, with the mets trading justin verlander back to the astros, and max scherzer to the rangers. the two had a critical 3-game series in arlington looming on september 4-6 that saw the texas rangers must sweep to clinch the season series and a potential tiebreaker as the division race was close, and espn described it as \"what could be the biggest series in texas baseball history.\" the astros retained the silver boot by proceeding to demolish the rangers in the series, scoring six runs in the seventh inning of a 13-6 opening win before crushing texas in the latter two games with five home runs hit in each game, the first time that a team had won the lone star series seven seasons in a row since texas did so from 2007 to 2013. both teams reached the postseason in the same year for the first time since 2015, however, the roles were reversed, this time the astros won the al west while the rangers entered as a wild card team, with both advancing to the alcs to set up the first ever postseason meeting between the teams, and the first lcs to be held entirely in one state. on october 23, the texas rangers won the alcs match up in 7 games with a final score of 11-4 in game 7 with all wins for both teams coming on the road. in addition, the mayors of houston and arlington made a friendly wager that whichever mayor\\'s team lost the series would have to wear a jersey from the winning team to a city council meeting. after the astros lost the series, houston mayor sylvester turner honored the wager and indeed wore a rangers jersey to a city council meeting. notable players who played on both teams a total of 77 players have played for both franchises. but out of those 77, only 3 have played their entire careers for both teams: chuck jackson, mike richardt, and mike simms. only six players have played for both the rangers and astros against their in-state opponent since 2001. those players are: doug brocail, mike lamb, richard hidalgo, ivan \"pudge\" rodríguez, hunter pence, and robinson chirinos. nolan ryan, astros 1980-88, rangers 1989-93 ken caminiti, astros 1987-94, astros

       " 'preußens gloria, prussian army march collection ii, p. 240, is a well-known military march of the 19th century, composed by johann gottfried piefke (1817-1884). \"preußens gloria\" (\"the glory of prussia\" or \"prussia\\'s glory\") was written in 1871 after the kingdom of prussia\\'s victory in the franco-prussian war, which led to the unification of the german states into the new prussian-led german empire. as part of the victory parade of the returning troops, the march was performed for the first time in public in frankfurt an der oder, where piefke\\'s garrison was based. as piefke only performed it on important occasions, the march was unknown to a broader public for a long time. in 1909 the manuscript of the almost forgotten tune turned up and was reworked by army-musical inspector . shortly afterwards it was included in the collection of prussian army marches. when the nazi party came to power in 1933, the famous march became a staple of nationalistic triumph spurred by the propaganda movement for the reclaiming of former glory for the nation. the national people\\'s army of east germany was not allowed to play the march. references external links culture of prussia german military marches german patriotic songs compositions by johann gottfried piefke articles containing video clips',\n",

       " 'homestar runner is an american flash animated comedy web series and website created by mike and matt chapman, known collectively as the brothers chaps. the series centers on the adventures of a large and diverse cast of characters, headed by the titular character, homestar runner. it uses a blend of surreal humor, self-parody, satire, and references to popular culture, in particular video games, classic television, and popular music. homestar runner originated in 1996 as a book written by mike chapman and craig zobel, intended as a parody of children\\'s literature. whilst learning macromedia flash, mike and his brother matt expanded the concept into a website, which was launched on new year\\'s day 2000. while the site originally centered on the title character, the strong bad email cartoon skits quickly became the site\\'s most popular and prominent feature, with strong bad, initially the series\\' main antagonist, becoming a breakout character. since 2000, the site has grown to encompass a variety of cartoons and web games featuring homestar, strong bad, and numerous other characters. at the peak of its popularity, the site was one of the most-visited sites with collections of flash cartoons on the web, spreading via word of mouth. the site sustains itself through merchandise sales and has never featured advertisements. the brothers chaps have turned down offers to make a television series. after a four-year hiatus beginning in 2010, homestar runner returned with a new holiday toon on april 1, 2014, for april fools\\' day. afterwards, co-creator matt chapman announced plans to give the site semi-regular updates starting in fall 2014, due to the positive reception given to the april fools\\' day cartoon. since global support for flash ended on december 31, 2020, homestarrunner.com has maintained a fully functional website through the flash emulator ruffle. more cartoons have since been released on the website and its youtube channel on an occasional basis, usually to celebrate holidays. history 1996-2000: development homestar runner was created in atlanta in 1996 by university of georgia students mike chapman and friend craig zobel, who wrote the original picture book, the homestar runner enters the strongest man in the world contest, while working summer jobs surrounding the 1996 summer olympics. matt described the origin of the name \"homestar runner\" as a in-joke between themselves and james huggins, a childhood friend of the chapman brothers while growing up in dunwoody, georgia. when mike and craig were in a bookstore and made a remark about how \"awful\" the children\\'s books were, the idea to write their own children\\'s book occurred to them. they spent around two hours designing the look of homestar runner, pom pom, strong bad, and the cheat, and completed the book within a day. they only printed about five to ten copies to share with friends, and had no intention to publish it. however, they had no idea that their father had sent out the book as a manuscript for submission to about 80 different publishers, but they only got rejection letters back, if anything. the pair began to work on a sequel, homestar runner goes for the gold, which would have introduced strong bad\\'s brothers, strong mad and strong sad, but was eventually abandoned. they later used the super nes video game mario paint to create the first cartoon featuring the characters. 2000-2009: launch and initial popularity around 1999, mike recognized how popular flash animation was taking off, and he and his younger brother matt chapman started to learn flash on their own. looking for something on which to practice, they found inspiration in the old \"children\\'s\" book. their initial cartoons were launched on their dedicated website, homestarrunner.com, by 2000. mike animated the cartoons, matt provided the voices of the male characters, and mike\\'s girlfriend (now wife) missy palmer provided the voice of marzipan. they initially started off with shorts that featured competitions between homestar runner as a heroic character and strong bad as the villain, but these did not really capture viewers. mike and matt came up with the idea of animating the scenes between competitions; matt stated \"that was the stuff that was funnier, the stuff happening between the plot points, which is hilarious because we hadn\\'t even established a routine of making cartoons about competitions, we\\'d made like one\". from may 2000 to february 2001, the website and cartoons started out with different art styles. in february 2001, it gained a new look, which has largely remained consistent to the present with minor changes. the site grew slowly at first and primarily through word-of-mouth. they were able to sell a \"few dozen\" t-shirts by 2001. mike moved back to new york in mid-2001 and he and matt started crafting the first strong bad email some kinda robot, intending this to be a weekly feature. the strong bad email series proved very popular, generating significant interest in the site; when the brothers were late in publishing a new strong bad email, they received angry emails asking where the new short was, which matt said was \"a cool feeling to know you\\'re as important as a cup of coffee or morning crossword to some folks\". their father suggested matt quit his full-time job to devote time to creating more homestar runner shorts. with the number of visitors to the site growing, by january 2003 the site had outgrown its original web host, yahoo!. merchandise sales paid for all of the costs of running the website as well as living costs of the creators, whose retired parents managed many of the business aspects. the brothers considered the period between 2002-2005 to be their most creative and successful, exploring various different media for the shorts and having a large quantity of merchandise. matt considered a day in february 2004 to be the highlight of the series, having received a demo tape from they might be giants for a song to use in a strong bad email short and a life-sized replica of tom servo from mystery science theater 3000 producer jim mallon on the same day. they also reflected on how homestar runner had been a common point of reference over which newly formed couples bonded and how joss whedon incorporated references to homestar runner into his television shows buffy the vampire slayer and angel as further signs of success. 2009−2014: hiatus through 2010, homestar runner remained financially viable for the brothers through sales of related merchandise. both brothers were married by 2010 and had their children to care for, and they recognized that they would need to find other jobs to support their respective families. when matt had a second daughter, the two agreed to put the series on hiatus, knowing they would want to come back to it but could not guarantee a time frame. mike also noted that they had spent nearly ten years delivering a weekly cartoon, and believed that, creatively, they needed a break. the success of homestar runner led to matt and mike getting writing jobs for television animated series yo gabba gabba!, gravity falls, the aquabats! super show!, and wander over yonder. during this hiatus, the brothers released a small number of homestar runner cartoons, including ones for 2010\\'s april fools\\' day and decemberween holidays. they also made a special video featuring homestar and strong bad for the 2013 san diego comic-con to introduce a panel regarding the history of w00tstock. 2014-present: comeback matt, after completing work on gravity falls, moved back to atlanta in 2014 where mike was living, and the two agreed that they now had the opportunity to return to homestar runner on a semi-regular basis. their first short in nearly four years, posted on april 1, 2014, poked fun at how they had not updated the site in years. matt confirmed their commitment to continue the series in july 2014. since then, the site has featured occasional updates, usually for holidays. until 2017, this was mostly due to the brothers\\' involvement in developing the disney xd animated show two more eggs. with the discontinuation of adobe flash by the end of 2020, most new homestar runner content was released directly as videos to youtube; they also worked to re-record the older flash content into video format for archival purposes. one exception was the release of the last update to the flash game stinkoman 20x6 on december 20, 2020, which included the promised final level after fifteen years. on december 31, 2020, the website was updated to use the ruffle flash emulator, ensuring its content will remain accessible after the discontinuation of flash player the same day. however, some of the newer flash material made right before the 2020 updates have some issues with some flash files when running on the site, due to ruffle still being in its early stages. characters homestar runner cartoons typically center on homestar runner, strong bad, and the other ten main characters of the cheat, marzipan, coach z, bubs, strong sad, strong mad, pom pom, the king of town, the poopsmith, and homsar. they\\'ve been described as \"dumb animal characters\" by the brothers chaps. many alternate variations of these character also exist such as \"old-timey\" and \"20x6\" versions of each character. the main characters have many roles throughout the homestar runner universe. cartoons homestar runner features several spin-off series from the main \"shorts\" and \"big toons\", including the most well-known, strong bad email. strong bad email strong bad emails (also known as \"sbemails\") is a series featuring strong bad answering emails from fans. since starting in august 2001, the initially brief episodes have grown in length and scope, introducing numerous spin-offs, characters, and inside jokes, such as homsar, trogdor, senor cardgage, 20x6, the teen girl squad shorts, and homestar runner emails (also known as \"hremails\"). the format, however, has remained largely unchanged. each episode typically begins with strong bad singing a short song to himself while booting up his computer to check fan emails. starting a reply, he typically mocks the sender\\'s name, spelling, and grammar, and rarely answers questions directly. while early episodes focused mostly on strong bad sitting at the computer with occasional cutaways, the cutaways would become more elaborate over time, allowing for more complex story lines to develop, growing tangentially from the initial email. each episode closes with strong bad finishing his reply, closing the episode with a link to email strong bad appearing via \"the paper\", a dot matrix printer at the top of the screen. in later episodes, it is replaced with the \"new paper\", an inkjet printer, then with the \"compé-per\", a pop-up balloon, and finally with a cgi version of the original paper, which instead promotes strong bad\\'s twitter account. as of april 1, 2022, 209 strong bad emails have been released on the website (with another six exclusive to dvd releases), separable into distinct eras by strong bad\\'s different computers; the tandy 400, the compy 386, the lappy 486, the compé, and his current computer, the lappier. holiday specials prior to the 2010 hiatus, holiday specials were a regular feature of the site, released to coincide with popular holidays, specifically halloween and decemberween (a fictional holiday similar to christmas also celebrated on december 25). halloween shorts typically feature the main characters celebrating a traditional aspect of the holiday (such as ghost stories, trick-or-treating or pumpkin carving) in costume, often making obscure pop culture references. the site also usually releases a separate halloween video where strong bad views a slideshow and mocks and/or appraises photos sent in by real life fans of their halloween costumes and props modeled after homestar runner characters and other elements. similarly, decemberween cartoons typically satirize christmas traditions such as gift-giving and carol-singing. the fact that it takes place on the same day as christmas has been presented as just a coincidence, having been stated that decemberween takes place \"55 days after halloween\". april fools\\' day features various gags, such as turning the site into a paid subscription service, or turning it upside down. other holidays celebrated include new year\\'s day, \"the big game\" (around the time of the super bowl), st. valentine\\'s day, mother\\'s day, \"senorial day\" (a parody of memorial day featuring the character senor cardgage), flag day, independence day, labor day (occasionally referred to as \"labor dabor\"), thanksgiving, and easter. teen girl squad teen girl squad is a crudely drawn comic strip narrated by strong bad, using a falsetto voice. the series was a spin off of strong bad email 53, comic, in which strong bad is asked to make a comic strip of a girl and her friends. the comic features four archetypal teenage girls, \"cheerleader\", \"so and so\", \"what\\'s her face\" and \"the ugly one\", and satirizes high school life, teen movies, and television. each episode follows the girls in typical high school situations, often leading to their gruesome deaths. a spinoff of this series is \"4 gregs\", which follows four of the squad\\'s nerdy classmates, all named greg. marzipan\\'s answering machine marzipan\\'s answering machine is a series of cartoons with almost no animation. it features messages from the other characters, being played on the answering machine belonging to the character marzipan. in early episodes, the episode number ended in .0 (for example, marzipan\\'s answering machine version 5.0), but since marzipan changed to a new answering machine, the number ends in .2 (for example, marzipan\\'s answering machine version 15.2). in every episode, strong bad prank calls marzipan, badly pretending to be someone else, such as \"detective everybody\", \"safety dan\", and sometimes other characters. although the animation is usually just a picture of the answering machine, sometimes there are short animated segments featuring the characters. as of april 1, 2016, there are 17 marzipan\\'s answering machines. puppet stuff these are live action shorts in which the regular characters are depicted by puppets. these may be skits, or musical performances with they might be giants. many puppet stuff videos feature the characters interacting with children, often related to the brothers chaps. one spin-off series, \"biz cas fri\", depicts homestar and strong bad\\'s interactions from his office cubicle at work. the first biz cas fri video arguably first coined the term doge. powered by the cheat these are a parody of poorly animated internet cartoons and are made by the cheat. he has done work for strong bad, coach z, and peacey p. he even filled in for strong bad on an email one week. the other characters have given mixed opinions on his work. alternate universes over time, many alternate versions of the homestar runner world and characters would appear, parodying other cartoons and animation styles. many of these feature in their own cartoons. the many alternate universes would later cross over in some cartoons, such as the 150th strong bad email, alternate universe. old-timey cartoons take place in an old-time setting, with most of the characters being old-timey counterparts of the homestar runner characters. these cartoons are in black and white with a film grain effect and scratchy audio quality. they parody the distinctive style of animated cartoons during the 1920s and 1930s (à la steamboat willie), and can be seen as perhaps deliberately unfunny, to make a slanted joke about such old-style cartoons. 20x6 (pronounced \"twenty exty-six\"), a parody of the mega man and earthbound games\\' \"year 200x\", originated from strong bad email 57, japanese cartoon, an email asking strong bad what he would look like if he were in a japanese anime. the main character, stinkoman, is an anime version of strong bad with blue hair, a shiny body and robot boots. he is always looking for a fight, asking various characters he interacts with to engage him in a \"challenge\" (\"are you asking for a challenge?\"). there is also a game, stinkoman 20x6, which is heavily based on the mega man series. cheat commandos is a parody of g.i. joe that features a cast of characters that are the same species as the cheat. most are based on g.i. joe characters, or characters from other 1980s cartoons. the cartoon is constantly advertising its products in the cartoons by such methods as referring to the areas they are in as \"playsets\", a convoy truck as an \"action figure storage vehicle\", and by ending each cartoon with the phrase \"buy all our playsets and toys!\", sung in a patriotic way. it also parodies the g.i. joe cartoons\\' use of public service announcements, referring to nonsensical things like \"peer-2-teen choice behaviors\". some cartoons feature the character crack stuntman, the fictional voice actor for the cheat commandos character gunhaver. other media music the homestar runner site frequently features songs and videos within their animated shorts or as stand-alone entities. these are primarily sung and performed either by the characters or by fictitious artists serving as parodies of various genres. real-life musicians they might be giants have also appeared occasionally, performing with a homestar puppet, or with the characters in the video to their song experimental film. they have also collaborated on several other shorts, including strong bad email 200, email thunder. in strong bad email 58, dragon, strong bad is asked to draw a dragon, creating trogdor, the burninator (stylised as trogdor, the burni̇nator), and performing his heavy metal theme song. trogdor\\'s popularity saw the character appear on merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and posters, with an extended version of the song appearing on the cd strong bad sings. in 2002, a fictional hair metal band, limozeen, was introduced as a parody of 1980s bands such as skid row, white lion and poison; with songs including \"because, it\\'s midnite\" and \"nite mamas\". on march 17, 2008, \"limozeen\" (actually the atlanta indie band y-o-u along with matt chapman on vocals) performed a live show in atlanta, georgia, and again on november 8, 2008, opening for indie pop band of montreal. a college rock band called sloshy (with the logo stylized in lower case and rotated 180 degrees, with the \"o\" being a different color, as \"ʎɥsoןs\") was introduced in 2007. sloshy features songs in the musical vein of pavement such as \"we don\\'t really even care about you\" and \"the b-est of b-sides\". other fictitious artists include scandinavian death metal parody taranchula (although performing more in a thrash metal/sludge metal style); rapper peacey p, with a rapping style resembling that of snoop dogg; and the self-absorbed r&b artist tenerence love, a parody of barry white and such artists. web games beyond cartoons, homestar runner offers a variety of online games. early games such as the homestar soundboard, \"homestar talker\", and lite-brite emulator \"astro-lite 2600\" are basic web toys featuring the characters, and can now be found on the \"old games\" section of the site. over time, more recent games have diversified and become more complex, with many being released as products of \"videlectrix\", a game company within the world of homestar runner and a side project of the brothers chaps, spoofing games of the 1980s. often the games would originate as video games played by the characters in the cartoon, such as secret collect, strongbadzone, and strong bad\\'s rhinofeeder, all parodies of early atari and arcade games, originating in the strong bad email video games. trogdor! which previously appeared in the arcade game short, features the titular dragon trogdor the burninator attempting to burn all the cottages on each stage without being slain by knights. a spin-off of trogdor!, called peasant\\'s quest, is an adventure game featuring rather dashing, a young peasant in short pants. after he finds his cottage burned to the ground, he vows to kill the destroyer of his cottage, trogdor. the game uses a system that is a near-replica of sierra entertainment\\'s adventure game interpreter, used in king\\'s quest, space quest and several other early sierra titles. this system is something like text adventure games yet it has simple visuals. stinkoman 20x6 is a mega man-style platform game featuring the characters and world of anime parody 20x6. nine levels were added to the game over the course of 2005, while the tenth and final level was not released until december 2020, days before flash would no longer be supported by browsers. the thy dungeonman series are parodies of text adventure games originating from strong bad email 94, video games. in each game, your goal is to \"get ye flask\". though the game purports to be set in the medieval era, the text is actually rendered in mock early modern english, in the style of william shakespeare. thy dungeonman has two sequels: thy dungeonman ii, which expands on the features of the original game and can only be found on the videlectrix site, and thy dungeonman iii which adds basic graphics and can be found on the homestar runner site. \"ye flask\" and \"you can\\'t get ye flask\" have become catch-phrases in the homestar runner universe, eventually spawning a t-shirt in the homestar runner store. in 2007, the website produced wii versions of some of the games on the site, for the wii internet browser. when played on the computer, they use the mouse only. a small number of the point-and-click adventure web games have been ported to unity by the brothers chaps and released via steam and itch.io, including halloween hide & seek and dangeresque: the roomisode triungulate. strong bad\\'s cool game for attractive people on april 10, 2008, an episodic licensed game based on the series centering around strong bad titled strong bad\\'s cool game for attractive people (abbreviated as sbcg4ap) was

telltale games website. poker night at the inventory strong bad appears as one of the computer-controlled opponents in telltale\\'s poker night at the inventory, using the same model from sbcg4ap. players can unlock in-game card sets and table designs based on homestar runner. additionally, strong bad will occasionally bet dangeresque too\\'s sunglasses in place of in-game cash; defeating him after doing so will unlock the glasses as an equippable cosmetic item for the demoman in team fortress 2. the game was released for pc and mac on november 22, 2010. trogdor!! the board game trogdor!! the board game is a board game made by the brothers chaps in collaboration with james ernest. the campaign was put on kickstarter on tuesday, july 17, 2018, with a goal of $75,000, which was surpassed in the first few hours. the campaign ended on wednesday, august 15, 2018, with a total of $1,421,903 (nearly 20 times the goal) and 23,338 backers. extra copies are sold in the website\\'s store. trogdor!! is described as a cooperative puzzle area control game in which the players work together to burninate all of the game tiles, thatched-roof cottages, and peasants. every player controls trogdor, assuming the role of one of the twelve \"keepers of trogdor\". each keeper has unique powers and items, both decided by cards. the game is for one to six players, and play time is 30 minutes

       " 'the ar-3d was a military air traffic control and early warning radar developed by plessey and first produced in 1975. it used a pencil beam and simple frequency scanning system known as \"squint scan\" to produce a low-cost 3d radar system that was also relatively mobile. about 23 were produced in total and found sales around the world into the early 1980s. the frequency scanning system had the disadvantage that a target aircraft would always be \"painted\" by the same frequency signal, which made the task of jamming the radar simpler. this limited its sales prospects to military users, and shortly after delivering the ar-3d the company began negotiations with the us company itt-gillifan to incorporate their multi-frequency scanning with the ar-3d\\'s receivers and display systems to produce the plessey ar-320. history squint during the installation of the first high-power microwave frequency radars using slot antennas, operators of the ames type 14 noticed that the apparent angle of the \"blips\" on the radar display did not always match the physical angle of the antenna. this was traced to an effect in the waveguides, which had slightly different transmission characteristics based on frequency. when the cavity magnetron warmed and cooled during use, its frequency changed slightly, and a delay was introduced in the waveguide. this caused the signal to no longer exactly match the positioning of the radiators in the antenna, and caused the beam to shift. this effect became known as \"squint\" and was generally considered annoying, especially on the ames type 80 where servicing the magnetron required a lengthy recalibration process to bring the beam back in line with the antenna. through the 1960s, significant effort was put into developing \"squintless feeds\" that avoided this problem, but the problem also presented an opportunity. squint is caused by the waveguide system slowing the signal by different amounts depending on the frequency. if the signal exits through a slotted waveguide antenna, this slight shift in timing produces a phase shift of the output. this shift will cause the resulting wavefront to change direction. this is the basis of the phased array radar, which normally accomplishes this using signal delay electronics. as squint causes a similar delay, it can also be used to steer the beam. this leads to the possibility of radar that can scan its beam in a chosen direction, typically vertically, with no moving parts. squirt another technique that was being widely explored in the late 1950s and early 1960s was the technique of pulse compression. pulse compression greatly increases the range resolution of a radar, which was formerly defined almost entirely by its pulse width. to get the required resolution in older designs, pulses were very short, typically a few microseconds, which required massive power output in order to produce a detectable reflected signal. using pulse compression, the pulses could be much longer, at least ten times, meaning the same return signal would be produced with the peak output. pulse compression works by changing the frequency of the signal over the time of the pulse and then delaying the returned signal based on its frequency. this compresses the return into a short pulse that can then be used for accurate ranging. this presented a potential issue in a radar using squint scanning, which would presumably send the signals in different directions if pulse compression were used. it appeared that as long as the beam steering was at the right speed it would be possible to do both; a given target would only see a small change in frequency as the beam scanned passed it, but the signal would dwell on any one target long enough that there would be a notable frequency shift during the resulting reflection that could be used for pulse compression. in 1964, plessey won a contract to consider the issue and began development of an experimental system. this was completed in 1967 as squirt. early tests demonstrated the system worked in theory, but the returned signal was weak and the system did not have the desired detection range. the system was modified and testing resumed in 1968 with the result that the detection range had improved but the height finding accuracy was lower than desired. it was finally concluded that the difference in the performance of the system across the 10 mhz bandwidth was too great to be practical. ar-3d plessey felt the basic concept still offered significant benefits, at least in less-demanding roles, and that it could be greatly improved by increasing the bandwidth past what was possible with its original 1960s-era systems. in 1973 they received ministry of defence (mod) funding to build an example set with a potential 150 mhz bandwidth, which was operational the next year. in 1975, the company put it on the market as the ar-3d, offered for military air traffic control (atc) and \"limited air defense purposes\". the ideal market would be day-to-day traffic control around a military airport, where the secondary function of early warning would still be useful. it was displayed publicly at the paris air show in 1975. at the time, they predicted sales of up to 50 systems worldwide. the system as a whole consisted of the antenna and its mount, six short semi-trailers of equipment, and one full-length semi-trailer with the operations room. it was airmobile via chinook helicopter. sales followed with egypt taking three units, south africa ten, and qatar and ecuador two each. the raf used one in germany for atc around raf gatow and sent two to the falkland islands in january 1983 followed by another in february 1984. according to burr, the countries were assigned code names, with penguin referring to the uk ministry of defence, and rodent, condor, lion and falcon to outside-uk sales. this list shows a total of 23 examples being produced. those used by the raf were given the name ames type 94. newspaper reports from 1986 state another six were sold to iran, but it is not clear if this is included in the list above or represents new-build systems. given the late date of the sale, this may be systems \"recycled\" from raf use or other sales. ar-320 although successful in the market, the ar-3d had the significant disadvantage in the military role in that a particular target would always be \"painted\" by the same frequency signal, and thus jamming the signal would be greatly simplified. most other 3d radars of the era did not use squint scanning and thus did not suffer from this problem. seeking a way to apply their work on the ar-3d to a new frequency agile radar, plessey entered an agreement with itt-gilfillan of los angeles. gilfillan also used squint scanning, but did so at different frequencies with each pulse, and thus avoided the problems with the ar-3d. gilfillan supplied a new antenna and transmitters, while plessey supplied suitably modified versions of the existing receiver and display systems. the result was the plessey ar-320, which replaced the ar-3d in the market. description the system was packaged as a complete unit known as the type 40/80-5 command and control post. this consisted of the antenna unit on a four-legged mounting, a transmitter cabin, two diesel generators, communications cabin, workshop cabin and the processing and control cabin. most of these were in the form of short semi-trailers, although the processing and control cabin was full-length. although designed primarily to be pulled by prime movers, the system was also airmobile via chinook helicopter. the antenna rotated around its vertical axis to scan in azimuth. the reflector took the form of a vertical cylindrical paraboloid, with the lower corners cropped off. the end-fed slot feed antenna was held in front of the reflector by three sets of legs forming triangular supports, one at the top and two at the bottom, the lowest also feeding the signal. the antenna was mounted at one end of its support platform, seemingly unbalanced, while the transmitter cabin was positioned at the other where it connected to a waveguide running along the top of the platform. the transmitter used two stages, the first being a travelling wave tube and the second a grid klystron. total peak power was 1.1 mw while average power was 10 kw. the transmitter had a bandwidth of 140 mhz during its 36 microseconds pulses. on reception, the signal was converted to an intermediate frequency and then split into eight signal paths, each of which accepted a range of frequencies in order to perform coarse vertical angle determination. pulse compression was then added using an acoustic surface wave filter, compressing it to 100 nanoseconds. the lowest elevation \"beams\" also had moving target indication clutter suppression to eliminate ground returns. the output of the receivers was then sent to a plot extractor, which identified moving objects in the returns and attempted to automatically assign tracking information - direction and speed. the result was then sent to the multiple displays in the processing and control cabin. the data could also be sent over datalink via the communications cabin. references citations bibliography ground radars military radars of the united kingdom

       " 'the killer in the backseat (also known as high beams) is an urban legend from the united states and united kingdom. it was first noted by folklorist carlos drake in 1968 in texts collected by indiana university students. legend the legend involves a woman who is driving and being followed by a car or truck. the mysterious pursuer flashes his high beams, tailgates her, and sometimes even rams her vehicle. when she finally makes it home, she realizes that the driver was trying to warn her that there was a man (a murderer, or escaped mental patient) hiding in her back seat. each time the man sat up to attack her, the driver behind had used his high beams to scare the killer, causing him to duck back down. in some versions, the woman stops for gas, and the attendant asks her to come inside to sort out a problem with her credit card. inside the station, he asks if she knows there\\'s a man in her back seat. (an example of this rendition can be seen in the 1998 episode of millennium, \"the pest house\".) in another, she sees a doll on the road in the moors, stops, and then the man gets in the back. in another version, the woman gets into her car and then a crazed person leaps out from nowhere and starts shouting gibberish and slamming their hands on the car. the woman quickly manages to escape from them but no matter how far or which direction she drives, every time she stops, the same crazy person appears and attacks the car. the woman then arrives at a police station and tells the police about the crazed person. the police calm her down and offer to drive her back to her house (or a safe place in other versions). but when they go with her to get her things from the car, they find the killer hiding behind the driver\\'s seat. as it turns out, the crazed person that was chasing the woman was the ghost of one of the killer\\'s victims, trying to either warn the woman or get at the killer. origin the story has been identified as circulating at least as early as the late 1960s, and may have gained more widespread recognition after appearing in a letter to advice columnist ann landers in 1982. it has been speculated, including by snopes founder david mikkelson, that the legend may have been inspired by a vaguely similar case which took place in 1964, in which an escaped murderer hid in the backseat of a car, only to end up shot by the car\\'s owner, a police detective. other somewhat similar, though not identical, cases have since been noted, including by folklorist jan harold brunvand. interpretations the story is often told with a moral. the attendant is often a lumberjack, a trucker, or a scary-looking man: someone the driver mistrusts without reason. she assumes it is the attendant who wants to do her harm, when in reality it is he who saves her life. in popular culture the twilight zone episode \"perchance to dream\" is notable for its protagonist\\'s allusions to \\'that woman who was killed by a psychopath hiding in the back seat of her car\\', in an episode first broadcast around eight or nine years before the story is believed to have entered into urban legend. it is unknown if this is pure coincidence or deliberately referencing some otherwise unrecorded \\'proto-myth\\', or even perhaps helped to inspire the legend. john carpenter\\'s 1978 film halloween has the character annie brackett killed when she enters the car and the killer michael myers sneaks up from behind the back seat and slashes her throat. a version of the story by author alvin schwartz appears in the 1981 collection of short horror stories for children scary stories to tell in the dark. terror in topanga, the first segment of the 1983 anthology film nightmares, is a depiction of this legend. the story is featured in a 1992 an episode of the simpsons when otto tells lisa the legend as a bedtime story. in his version, the victim is chased by another car that keeps ramming her vehicle, and she drives off the road into the woods and loses the other car. she is then killed by an axe-wielding maniac who had been hiding in her backseat. he then reveals himself to be said maniac. the 1998 film urban legend begins with this scenario. in a 1998 episode of millennium, \"the pest house\", frank black chases a doctor from a mental hospital after one of its patients escapes into the back of her car and tries to kill her. when she pulls over at a gas station, the attendant saves her by taking her inside. the story is featured in a 1998 episode of the television show beyond belief: fact or fiction under the title \"bright lights\". a 2003 episode of the detective series jonathan creek, \"the coonskin cap\", begins with a version of this legend, except that instead of a killer inside the car, the pursuing driver is trying to alert the woman that there is a body tied to the back of her car. the 2003 tamil film from india, whistle, begins with this scenario. in the 2009 film zombieland, columbus (jesse eisenberg) explains to tallahassee (woody harrelson) that rule 10 of surviving a zombie apocalypse is to check the backseat for hidden dangers, such as re-animated zombies. later on in the film, after getting robbed at gunpoint again, tallahassee admits to columbus that wichita (emma stone) and little rock (abigail breslin) got the drop on him and tallahassee because he (tallahassee) didn\\'t check the backseat. in the 2013 film curse of chucky, nica pierce is sent to a psychiatric hospital, suspected of a set of killings committed by chucky. as the arresting officer gets into his car, tiffany valentine, who had been hiding in the back seat, slits his throat with a nail file. in the 2015 episode of scream queens, \"ghost stories\", chanel 5 (played by abigail breslin) is driving and a truck starts honking at her and using his high beams. when she pulls over at a petrol station, he tells her about the red-devil (the murderer), lurking in her back seat but then he is stabbed by it while 5 makes her escape. the 2022 episode of american horror stories, \"drive\", marci (played by bella thorne) is driving home from a night club and a jeep starts flashing its high beams at her. marci loses the jeep and hides behind a car wash. her friend piper tells marci of the legend. later, it\\'s revealed the driver of the jeep really did

janet and colin bord, later authors of mysterious britain (janet also wrote for flying saucer review and lionel beer\\'s spacelink, while colin\\'s fortean article in gandalf\\'s garden was particularly cited by rickard as bringing him/them to his attention); phil ledger, a \"peripatetic marine biologist\", and the news\\' \"first enthusiastic fan\"; ken campbell, fortean theatre director and playwright; john michell; graphic designer richard adams and dick gwynn, who both helped with the evolving layout and typesetting of later issues; chris squire, who helped organise the first subscription database; canadian \"mr. x\"; mike dash; and cartoonist hunt emerson. emerson was introduced to rickard in late 1974, when after seven issues, he \"wanted to improve the graphics\", which emerson certainly did, providing around 30 headings for use in issues 8 onwards. (emerson\\'s still-on-going monthly \"phenomenomix\" strip in ft had its prototype in 11\\'s three-page \"fortean funnies\"). notable news content other early contributors included writer and researcher nigel watson (chairman of the scunthorpe ufo research society), who wrote \"mysterious moon\" for the news 2. watson later wrote a regular column of ufo commentary entitled enigma variations (from 29), and articles on the subject of ufo-related murders and stories of sexual assault by aliens. phil grant wrote about ley lines for 3, and mary caine, who revised an earlier article (from gandalf\\'s garden) on the glastonbury zodiac for issue 4, which also had the debut of the \"reviews\" section, beginning with comments on a book by john michell, the sphere reprint of charles fort\\'s new lands and john sladek\\'s the new apocrypha. issues 2 and 3 noted, the news was published \"with an arrangement with info\", this was revised from 4 to it being \"affiliated to the international fortean organization\". from 5, mark a. hall produced a section entitled \"fortean usa\", continuing on from his earlier, discontinued, newsletter from my files; issue 5 also had william porter\\'s article on llandrillo printed, after being delayed from 4 for space constraints. janet bord contributed \"some fortean ramblings\" alongside william r. corliss\\'s \"the evolution of the fortean sourcebooks\" for 7, and issue 8 was the first issue of volume 2, after rickard decided to end volume 1 with 7 (not 6 as fully bimonthly titles do), since that issue was dated november \\'74, thereby attempting to keep each volume aligned with a year. issue 8 (or, volume 2, issue 1) got the special \"christmas present\" of headings by hunt emerson, after rickard was introduced to emerson by carol and nick moore, as hunt was working on large cow comix. described by rickard as \"as much a disciple of george [herriman]... and my [rickard\\'s] favourite artists from mad (bill elder and wally wood)\" as rickard was of charles fort, the two got on well, with emerson producing not only a series of headings, but also later strips and covers for issues to the present. the death of info co-founder ron willis was announced in 9, which described itself as providing \"bimonthly notes on fortean phenomena\", and an index to the first year\\'s issues ( 1-7) became available. colin bord penned \"amazing menagerie\" for issue 10, while paul devereux and andrew york compiled an exhaustive study of leicestershire in \"portrait of a fault area\", serialised in 11-12. issue 11 featured rickard and emerson\\'s first \"fortean funnies\" cartoon, while 12 had a price rise to 50p/$1.25, a logo change (from selfridges\\' herald-on-horseback to the more descriptive fort\\'s face-encircled) and a tweaking of its tagline to \"bimonthly news & notes on fortean phenomena.\" issue 14 first mentioned rickard and michell\\'s then-in-production book phenomena!, which would be more actively trailed from 18. issue 15 — now with 28 pages — announced that rickard had decided to bow to popular opinion and retitle his miscellany with a more descriptive title. thus, with a subtitle of \"portents & prodigies\", fortean times was born. fortean times (since 1976) after 15 issues of the news, issue 16 (1976) had the magazine renamed fortean times, which \"new title emerged from correspondence between bob rickard and paul willis\" — the two having talked of creating a fortean version of the times newspaper, \"full of weird and wonderful news and read by millions worldwide\". its cover bore the descriptive text \"strange phenomena — curiosities — prodigies — portents — mysteries,\" while the inside cover kept the \"fort face\" logo from later issues of the news, but bore the revised legend \"a contemporary record of strange phenomena\". included within was an offer for a \"4-colour silk-screened poster\" created by hunt emerson for this landmark issue. from the start, this new format compounded earlier financial difficulties for rickard, following on from 14\\'s plea: \"we need more subscribers or we die!\". (fortean times issues 16-18 — as the news 1-15 before them — were solely edited, published, and in large part written and typed by rickard himself. even by passing on rising postal and paper costs to the readership, which rickard constantly reiterates that he is loath to do, the early fortean times was constantly facing an uphill financial battle.) early editorials of the new ft, therefore (in fact beginning with the news 15) featured a notification of donations received, naming and thanking the hardcore readership (which included many current and future contributors) for monies received, which aided the move towards higher production values. with donations helping to offset costs, the price was held at 50p until issue 20, whereupon the magazine dropped to a quarterly schedule from spring 1977 (issue 21) — but raised the page count (and price) to continue producing the same amount of material for the same yearly fee (40 pg, 75p ea. or £3/year). issue 18 received a new semiregular feature entitled \"forteana corrigenda\", aimed at correcting \"errors in the literature\" that had crept into various fortean works through misquotation or other difficulties. after 18 more-or-less solo-produced issues, long-term supporter and helper steve moore was credited as assistant editor for issues 19-21, becoming co-contributing editor (with phil ledger, stan nichols, and paul j willis) on issues 22-26 and associate editor from issue 27. he was joined by contributing editor david fideler, and subsequently (also as co-associate editor) by paul sieveking ( 28— ) and valerie thomas ( 31-32). issue 20 announced that kay thompson (a staff member of ley hunter magazine, then under the editorship of paul devereux, with whom ft shared an address for several issues) would be helping to type parts of subsequent issues to further delegate the burden from rickard. moore, sieveking, and he were also later joined editorially by author mike dash (who is mentioned as particularly overseeing the publication of scholarly occasional papers), before moore moved from full editorial to largely correspondent duties for a dozen issues after 42, returning as a contributing editor in autumn 1990 ( 55). the four — rickard, sieveking, dash, and moore — are often collectively referred to as \"the gang of fort,\" after the gang of four. issue 21 had the debut of ft semiregular column \"strange deaths\" (later descriptively subtitled \"unusual ways of shuffling off this mortal coil\"), while issue 22 updated ft\\'s to include (ivan t. sanderson\\'s) the society for the investigation of the unexplained, alongside info. issue 23 featured an article by robert anton wilson on, aptly, \"the 23 phenomenon,\" made available a second index (1975, to the news 8-13) and included a 12-page \"review supplement\", issued as a separately bound supplement since the then-printers had difficulty binding more than 40 pages. with 24, the printers were changed to windhorse press to overcome this difficulty, and ft became officially 52 pages in length, the changes cemented in issue 25 with a new font for the title and a change of address — c/o london-based \"sf and cosmic\" bookshop dark they were and golden-eyed, run by derek stokes (who had sold rickard the four fort books 10 years previously). the same issue ran an obituary for eric frank russell, of whom rickard was a considerable fan. he writes that russell turned down an invitation to contribute material to the news back in 1973, having \"earned his rest\" after 40 years as an active fortean. rickard further states that russell was one of the key fortean-fiction writers he read in campbell\\'s astounding science fiction and analog, and the author of \"the first fortean book i [rickard] ever read\": russell\\'s great world mysteries. issue 26 trailed \"a special series of \\'occasional papers\\' in fortean subjects\" to be edited by steve moore, and 27 — the 5th anniversary issue — welcomed michigan-native david fideler (whose anomaly research bulletin was then due to cease publication, although its subscribers, ft promised, would be absorbed by them) as ft\\'s \"man in the new world\". paul sieveking and ft\\'s format change in 1978, mutual friend ion will introduced rickard to paul sieveking, who recalls, \"the forteans used to meet every tuesday afternoon above the science-fiction bookshop dark they were and golden-eyed in soho to open post and interact.

highlighting the intrinsic early difficulties in printing ft that that issue \"was printed by an israeli entrepreneur in northern greece and shipped to london.\" that issue ( 28), bearing a cover blurb of \"strange phenomena\", featured an early advertisement for the bookshop dark they were and golden-eyed, drawn by bryan talbot, while the editorial promised that the next issue would not only see the availability of index 1976, but also be in a \"larger and more professional format, typeset throughout, [with] better graphics, layout, and legibility.\" indeed, 29, under a cover by hunt emerson, was printed fully typeset in a4 (thanks to art director richard adams of adco, and,according to rickard\\'s preface to yesterday\\'s news tomorrow, dick gwynn) and even distributed on a limited basis through wh smiths. the move away from production on rickard\\'s typewriter gave \"the journal of strange phenomena,\" (as it was now subtitled) greater ability to produce longer, better laid-out articles. these opened with a seven-page guide to \"charles fort and fortean times\" by bob rickard, explaining the background and philosophy of ft, as well as outlining the influence of fort, \"who is still largely unknown\", writes rickard, and also included the first of nigel watson\\'s \"enigma variations\" columns and loren coleman\\'s \"devil names and fortean places\" article sat alongside comments by colin bord, tim dinsdale, vgw harrison, and rickard on anthony \\'doc\\' shiels\\' 1977 \"nessie\" photographs. the magazine itself dropped the description \\'non-profitmaking\\' from its publication information, and ceased to name its stated affiliations to info, situ, and \"other fortean journals\" in favour of the more general aim to be a \"friend to all groups and magazines continuing the work of charles fort\". it also contained a considerably higher number of advertisements, including both inside covers — making the page count slightly higher than previous issues, which had previously counted the cover as page 1 — and an early advertisement by brian bolland for forbidden planet (which would ironically begin to take off only after the closure of stokes\\' bookshop). issue 30 announced that while \"over the last couple of issues [the] subscriber list... nearly doubled,\" so too had the \"printing, production, and postage bill,\" necessitating a price rise to 95p/$2.50 — albeit softened by another length increase, to 68 pages. now published not merely by rickard, but by fortean times ltd, it was typeset by warpsmith graphics and printed by bija press. the cover was painted by una woodruff (whose inventorum natura was reviewed within) to illustrate john michell\\'s article on \"spontaneous images and acheropites,\" drawing on his 1979 thames & hudson book dealing with — and titled — simulacra. bob rickard produced an article on one \"clemente dominguez: pope, heretic, stigmatic\"; michael hoffman speculated on the occult aspects of a serial killer in \"the sun of sam\"; robert j. schadewald wrote about \"the great fish fall of 1859\", while hunt emerson produced the first cartoon strip under the title \"phenomenomix\". sieveking took over full editorial duties from rickard with 43, helming the subsequent four quarterly issues (to 46) to give rickard a chance to \"revitalize\", which he did, returning with 46 to the position of co-editor. moore, dash, and ian simmons (and others) variously edited the magazine for the next 18+ years, and although main editorship passed from rickard and sieveking to david sutton in 2002, they both continued to contribute. sieveking semiretired at the end of 2019, handing most of the \"strange days\" news editor role to christopher josiffe. sieveking continues to write the archaeology column, compile the \"extra, extra\" section, and edit the letters pages, also acting as the main quality-control proof-reader (as well as producing an occasional feature). sieveking\\'s wife val stevenson was book-review editor for several years, eventually passing this role on to david v. barrett in 2019. during the 40+ years of its publication, fortean times has changed both format and publishers on a few occasions. early issues (particularly of the news) were produced in black and white (for ease of photocopying), and the whole was largely produced by typewriter until 29. colour, professional printing, and wider distribution followed, and a 6.5- x 4.5-in size held sway for several years before the magazine settled into its \"normal\" a4 (magazine) size in the 1980s, after which glossy covers followed. several changes of logo and font have occurred throughout its life. general content the identification of correct original sources by contributors is a defining feature of the magazine, as it was for charles fort himself. however, the \"objective reality\" of these reports is not as important. the magazine \"maintains a position of benevolent scepticism towards both the orthodox and the unorthodox\" and \"toes no party line\". the range of subject matter is extremely broad, including: general forteana anomalous phenomena apparitions bizarre deaths conspiracy theories crop circles cryptozoology cults and would-be messiahs and prophets fringe science hoaxes millennialism, eschatology, and cases of mass hysteria mutants (human and animal) parapsychology religious phenomena (stigmata, appearances and simulacra and miracles, etc.) natural simulacra unidentified flying objects urban legends fortean times also frequently covers the ig nobel prizes, as well as unusual aspects of mainstream science and research. current content the magazine\\'s current regular contents include: three or four feature articles strange days, a wide-ranging overview of odd and interesting stories mostly culled from the world\\'s newspapers. some feature in particular sections, including: science archaeology (usually by paul sieveking and paul devereux) ghosts, in a column titled ghostwatch (by alan murdie) alien zoo, dr. karl shuker\\'s regular discussion of cryptozoological matters necrolog, obituaries of fortean-relevant individuals strange deaths, a long-running round-up of the odd manners in which some people meet their ends ufo files/saucers of the damned is by nigel watson who provides a \"regular survey of the latest fads and flaps from the world of ufology\"; \"ufo files/ufo casebook\" is jenny randles\\' \"round-up of sightings and hot-spots from around the world\" clippings for most of strange days\\' stories are requested from, and supplied by, the readers of ft mythconceptions, which debunks modern myths, old wives\\' tales, etc. (in a similar manner to, for example, snopes.com) classical corner, in which barry baldwin reviews fortean events from ancient times fortean bureau of investigation, which typically revisits and reassesses older fortean cases forum, featuring three or four shorter articles on diverse topics reviews of fortean, science fiction/fantasy and related books, films and computer games a letters page, incorporating: simulacra corner, photographs submitted by readers of (typically) naturally occurring objects which appear to be in the shape of something else \"it happened to me...\", readers\\' stories of strange personal occurrences fortean traveller, \"a guide to various sites of interest to the traveling fortean\" phenomenomix, a comic strip by hunt emerson praise and criticism most of the articles in fortean times are written in the style of objective journalism, but this is not a mandatory requirement, and some articles focus on a specific theory or point of view. although such articles are presented as the opinion of the author and not the editors (who claim to have no opinions), this has occasionally led to controversy. in january 1997, the magazine ran an article by david percy under the headline \"fake! did nasa hoax the moon landing photos?\". the article outraged many readers and led to the magazine\\'s most vigorous postbag up to that time. in august 2000, the magazine\\'s cover headline was \"ufo? the shocking truth about the first flying saucers\". the article in question, by james easton, proposed a mundane explanation for kenneth arnold\\'s sighting — american white pelicans. this suggestion so outraged ufologists that many of them still use the term \"pelican\" or \"pelicanist\" as a pejorative term for a debunker. most fortean researchers contribute articles, criticism, or letters to the magazine. it has also attracted more widespread coverage and praise. fortean times 69 claims, \"extracts from ft have featured in at least three publications used for teaching english as a foreign language.\" lynn barber of the independent on sunday newspaper described writing in ft as \"a model of elegant english.\" unconvention the magazine has organised an \"unconvention\" (or uncon), most years since 1994 (the \"missing\" years being 2001, 2005, and 2009), at various venues in london (the university of london union, the institute of education, the commonwealth institute, and in recent years, friends house). many \"hot topics\" of the day have been discussed, such as the ray santilli \"alien autopsy\" film at the 1996 uncon, and the death of diana, princess of wales at the 1998 event, which also saw lynn picknett and clive prince discussing templar conspiracies and hidden symbolism in the paintings of leonardo da vinci, years before these were turned into mass-media subjects by the da vinci code. besides the formal lecture programme, uncon normally features exhibits by organizations such as the association for the scientific study of anomalous phenomena and the centre for fortean zoology. the event often ends with a panel discussion, as was the case in 2002, when the subject was \"is ufology dead?\". this was widely reported in the british media as an \"official\" statement by fortean times that \"ufology is dead\". related projects fortean studies, the magazine\\'s more academic sister publication published yearly volumes in the late 1990s. the seventh and last issue was published in 2001. its website tracks fortean news stories and holds a small archive of articles and photographs. for many years, it also supported a busy internet forum for the discussion of fortean topics. with the advent of gdpr legislation in 2018, this forum was moved to the website of the charles fort institute. the magazine has also occasionally published both academic and lighthearted books on various aspects of forteana. collections and spin-off books many of the earliest issues of ft were collected in book format in the early 1990s. in recent years, the print volumes have been overtaken by digital files, available on cd. in addition, several smaller collections have been compiled on various themes and sold, or given away as \\'free gifts\\' with the magazine. a more academic journal, fortean studies, has also been printed and is an ongoing venture. in the late 1990s polygram spoken word released an audio version of several fortean stories, written and produced by steve deakin-davies and featured brian cant and joanna bowen amongst its actors, this project was licensed from john brown publishing.( (c) 1997 polygram record operations ltd, speaking volumes no: 5361444) fortean tomes starting in the very early 1990s, fortean times produced a number of facsimile editions collecting the earliest issues of the magazine, in their entirety, including advertisements. these collections, prepared and edited for print by paul sieveking (including hand corrections to early typographic errors) are now out-of-print. although demand was such to warrant reprints of several volumes, after collecting up to 77 ft decided that the previous volumes had not sold well enough to continue completely up to date. (concern over the likely cost of reprinting issues in the new full colour format led to a publishing decision to stockpile 500 unbound run-on copies of each number to provide the basis of future reprint editions, and this project resulted in one further collection — snakes alive!, collecting 93-97 — but the in-between issues 78-92 have not yet been collected in trade format.)

       " 'in computer security, organization-based access control (orbac) is an access control model first presented in 2003. the current approaches of the access control rest on the three entities (subject, action, object) to control the access the policy specifies that some subject has the permission to realize some action on some object. orbac allows the policy designer to define a security policy independently of the implementation. the chosen method to fulfill this goal is the introduction of an abstract level. subjects are abstracted into roles. a role is a set of subjects to which the same security rule apply. similarly, an activity is a set of actions to which the same security rule apply. and, a view is a set of objects to which the same security rule apply. each security policy is defined for and by an organization. thus, the specification of the security policy is completely parameterized by the organization so that it is possible to handle simultaneously several security policies associated with different organizations. the model is not restricted to permissions, but also includes the possibility to specify prohibitions and obligations. from the three abstract entities (roles, activities, views), abstract privileges are defined. and from these abstract privileges, concrete privileges are derived. orbac is context sensitive, so the policy could be expressed dynamically. furthermore, orbac owns concepts of hierarchy (organization, role, activity, view, context) and separation constraints. see also external links orbac site motorbac site (orbac simulation and conflict detection tool) computer access control access control',\n",

       " 'ocean rowing society international (orsi) (prior to 2006 known as ors), is the governing body for international ocean rowing and official adjudicator of ocean rowing records for guinness world records. orsi was founded in 1983 in california by ocean rower peter bird and kenneth f.crutchlow frgs. current coordinators of orsi are tatiana rezvaya-crutchlow and chris martin, and fiann paul. history the ocean rowing society (from 2006 - international) was founded in 1983 by kenneth frank crutchlow, with support of an ocean rower peter bird. the reason, that urged them to do it, was a letter from a french journalist, asking if there existed a list of british ocean rowers. he was writing about the row of french gerard d\\'aboville and wondered how to compare it to the achievements of the other ocean rowers. the main goal of the society was and still is to keep record of all attempts to row across the oceans. in 1983, after almost 90 years since the first ocean row in history, there had been only 32 attempts to row an ocean, and only 14 of them had been successful. the ocean rowing society completed full and accurate information about all and each of them, to verify and to classify every row in the pre-internet era. and since then, ors has been the only body that keeps records of all events in the field of ocean rowing activity. the ocean rowing society int. is an official adjudicator of ocean rowing records for the guinness world records. d. h. clarke from guinness world records in 1964 pioneered recording of ocean rows. he handed over to kenneth crutchlow all his notes that laid the basis for the statistics. and ocean rowers geoff allum and mike nestor, who provided ors with their records and numerous cuttings from press articles, and helped with the compiling of the first list of the statistics. in 2000 tom lynch, an american director of ors, handed over the maintenance of the website to ukrainian theodore rezvoy, who has designed website\\'s current interface and created logo of ors, placing there a saying in latin. it expresses the inner motto of this extreme adventure: \"nosce te ipsum\" - know thyself. \"know yourself, test yourself, challenge yourself and succeed - the greatest victory for an individual, that\\'s what all this is about.\" in 2001 tatiana rezvaya-crutchlow, became and still is the editor-in-chief of the ors website. she is in charge of maintaining and updating the general statistics, as well as compiling its various options, selected by the aspect of the route, category, class, age, gender, country, duration, etc. in 1980 kenneth for the first time used argos satellite beacons to track the row of peter bird across the pacific ocean from russian far east to san francisco; and hence, after launching the website, ors became the first to start monitoring and tracking rowers at sea, listing positions, plotting charts and posting them - along with the press articles, news and other information about and from rowers at sea, - making it available to public. ors has coordinated dozens of rows of individuals and in 2004 organized the first race with solos and four entrees (besides traditional teams of two - that had been the only class of entrees in races 1997, 2001 and 2003). it was then, that ors introduced a convenient way of tracking numerous boats on one chart on the webpage, by marking them as dots of different colors - the way adopted later by organizers of other races. ors has been one of the first contacts in the list of the coast guards, when it goes about rescue at sea of independent rowers. it assists by providing/confirming the necessary data, positions, contacts, etc. kenneth f.crutchlow was the first to organize a resupply of an ocean rower on route (peter bird, pacific ocean 1983) and then organized and participated in several resupplies of rowers and teams at sea - sailing and flying, or coordinating a meeting with a vessel or even another rowboat. orsi organized the first meeting of entries in the 1997 race and in 2002 - meeting with all women-ocean rowers, at the royal geographical society in london. it also organized lunches for ocean rowers with representatives of guinness world records on the occasions of awarding guinness certificates to ocean rowers. in 2000 ors formed a committee of ocean rowers who prepared \"guidelines\" for those who might themselves want to accept the challenge of an ocean row. there was established a record \"blue riband trophy of ocean rowing\", to be presented to the holders of the record \"the fastest row across the atlantic east to west along the \"trade winds i\", - the most popular and rowed route of all in the world oceans. in 2017 blue riband trophy was divided into two classes: classic and open. in 2003 ors came up with an idea of organizing free seminars, where ocean rowers, coast guard helicopter pilots, psychologists, specialists in survival at sea shared their experience with those who were planning or about to go to sea. ors sees as its task to keep alive and honor names of the past ocean rowers. a number of ocean rowboats related to the pioneers of ocean rowing have been saved from destruction, exhibited at several boat shows and finally presented to the relevant museums and organizations. in 2006 ors became orsi. in 2021 fiann paul developed a geodatabase that documents and processes the entire history of human-power ocean-exploration, dubbed by guinness world records \"the first real adventure database\". this database became the new orsi website. coordinators orsi is led by coordinators. the following list gives main coordinators since 1983: 1983 - 2016: kenneth f. crutchlow 2016 - present: tatiana rezvaya-crutchlow 2016 - present: chris martin 2019 - present: fiann paul see also international rowing federation human-powered watercraft world sailing references sports organizations established in 1983 ocean rowing',\n",

       " 'in computational geometry, the method of rotating calipers is an algorithm design technique that can be used to solve optimization problems including finding the width or diameter of a set of points. the method is so named because the idea is analogous to rotating a spring-loaded vernier caliper around the outside of a convex polygon. every time one blade of the caliper lies flat against an edge of the polygon, it forms an antipodal pair with the point or edge touching the opposite blade. the complete \"rotation\" of the caliper around the polygon detects all antipodal pairs; the set of all pairs, viewed as a graph, forms a thrackle. the method of rotating calipers can be interpreted as the projective dual of a sweep line algorithm in which the sweep is across slopes of lines rather than across - or -coordinates of points. history the rotating calipers method was first used in the dissertation of michael shamos in 1978. shamos used this method to generate all antipodal pairs of points on a convex polygon and to compute the diameter of a convex polygon in time. godfried toussaint coined the phrase \"rotating calipers\" and demonstrated that the method was applicable in solving many other computational geometry problems. shamos\\'s algorithm shamos gave the following algorithm in his dissertation (pp. 77-82) for the rotating calipers method, which generated all antipodal pairs of vertices on a convex polygon: / p[] is in standard form, ie, counter clockwise order, distinct vertices, no collinear vertices. angle(m, n) is a procedure that returns the clockwise angle swept out by a ray as it rotates from a position parallel to the directed segment pm,pm+1 to a position parallel to pn, pn+1 we assume all indices are reduced to mod n (so that n+1 = 1). / getallantipodalpairs(p[1..n]) // find first anti-podal pair by locating vertex opposite p1 i = 1 j = 2 while angle(i, j) area(i, i + 1, j)) j = j + 1 j0 = j while (i != j0) i = i + 1 yield i, j while (area(i, i + 1, j + 1) > area(i, i + 1, j)) j = j + 1 if ((i, j) != (j0, i0)) yield i, j else return if (area(j, i + 1, j + 1) = area(i, i + 1, j)) if ((i, j) != (j0, i0)) yield i, j + 1 else yield i + 1, j applications pirzadeh describes various applications of rotating calipers method. distances diameter (maximum width) of a convex polygon width (minimum width) of a convex polygon maximum distance between two convex polygons minimum distance between two convex polygons widest empty (or separating) strip between two convex polygons (a simplified low-dimensional variant of a problem arising in support vector machine based machine learning) grenander distance between two convex polygons optimal strip separation (used in medical imaging and solid modeling) bounding boxes minimum area oriented bounding box minimum perimeter oriented bounding box triangulations onion triangulations spiral triangulations quadrangulation nice triangulation art gallery problem wedge placement optimization problem multi-polygon operations union of two convex polygons common tangents to two convex polygons intersection of two convex polygons critical support lines of two convex polygons vector sums (or minkowski sum) of two convex polygons convex hull of two convex polygons traversals shortest transversals thinnest-strip transversals others non parametric decision rules for machine learned classification aperture angle optimizations for visibility problems in computer vision finding longest cells in millions of biological cells comparing precision of two people at firing range classify sections of brain from scan images see also convex polygon convex hull smallest enclosing box references geometric algorithms convex geometry',\n",

       " \"roubaix (), formerly known as perry or lewisville, is an unincorporated community in lawrence county, south dakota, united states. it is not monitored by the u.s. census bureau. naming roubaix was originally called lewisville, but it was changed to perry when the town gained a post office. when the chicago, burlington and quincy railroad began building into the black hills, the town again changed its name to avoid confusion with terry, which was nearby. roubaix was chosen in honor of the hometown of local frenchman pierre wibaux, who was one of the uncle sam mine's main investors. history founding and growth the mining camp was first settled in 1876. it was first a placer mining camp, with the primary source of gold being nearby elk creek. the town nearly disappeared after the uncle sam mine was shut down in 1880, and a forest fire destroyed a large portion of the town. the grand reopening of roubaix and its official recognition as a town was marked by a celebration in august 1885 at a beer hall, complete with a dance. in the years following 1891, due to failed mining activity, the town nearly became abandoned. in 1899, roubaix had 500 residents, a post office, several stores, a hospital, boarding houses, a newspaper, a barber shop, a few churches, and its own city hall. there was once a typhoid fever epidemic in the area. the town was home to several organizations, including a tennis club, literature group, whist club, and a miners' union. before the early 1900s, there was no designated school building, and classes were held in various buildings around camp. local mining operations roubaix relied heavily on the uncle sam mine, which was discovered in 1878 and produced gold. quartz was later harvested in a one-stamp mill that made $50,000. by 1880, the new mine had closed and was flooded. in 1885, more stamps for the stamp mills were brought from tigerville, and a 60-stamp mill was brought from esmeralda. by october 1886, after a change in management, the mine began to have trouble with its water pumps. the resulting drop in activity nearly caused roubaix to become abandoned. in 1898, the clover leaf gold mining company arrived, headed by pierre wibaux. they bought the mine and repaired the 60-stamp mill, fixed the buildings, brought in a sawmill, and had electricity installed. from 1889 to 1905, wibaux mined $900,000 worth of gold. most of the ore was pure, and simple mercury amalgamation allowed for 90% of the ore to be recovered. this new activity revived the town. however, wibaux's fellow miners began stealing the ore, causing him to lose profits. on june 4, 1905, the fires were pulled to clean the boilers, and the 7th-level sill floor caved in. the water blocked the pumps and caused them to burn out. pressure from the boiler caused the dam to break and flood the lower levels. a fissure in elk creek was supposed, and plans were made to build a diversion dam, but it was never executed. the mine was forced to be abandoned. the destruction of the mine caused the town of roubaix to decline. in 1934, the mine reopened but closed again in 1935, when the anaconda gold mining and milling company only mined $10,000 in gold. the land was sold to a private owner in 1937. later history and today the post office continued operation until the 1940s. the shaft house at the mine was destroyed during a windstorm in 1953, and the school was torn down in the 1960s. today, there are only a few of the old houses left standing. the foundations of the mine can still be seen. the only remnants of the mills are a couple of bullwheels. however, the town still has a very small population. there are no businesses in the town. geography roubaix is in the black hills of western lawrence county, at the coordinates . it is located on the east side of u.s. route 385 along elk creek and is approximately seven miles south of pluma. climate references see also pierre wibaux roubaix external links unincorporated communities in south dakota unincorporated communities in lawrence county, south dakota mining communities in south dakota\",\n",

the french fourragère in the colors of the military medal; two korean presidential citations; and three american distinguished unit citations. forty-four of the french casualties were eventually buried at the united nations memorial cemetery in busan, south korea. in an address to a joint session of the united states congress on 22 may 1952, general ridgway said the following: one member of the french battalion, louis misseri, was awarded the distinguished service cross by the united states for his actions. his citation reads: paul l. freeman jr., the commander of the 23rd infantry regiment, said of the french battalion: post korea on october 22, 1953, the french battalion embarked on the and headed for indochina, where it was expanded into a two battalion regiment and formed the nucleus of the french groupement mobile 100. during their service in indochina, the unit (under its new title of le regiment de corée) participated in the brutal battle of mang yang pass along route coloniale 19 in june and july 1954, where it suffered heavy casualties. between its arrival in indochina and the cease-fire on july 20, 1954, the 1st battalion suffered 238 killed or wounded, and the 2nd battalion 202 killed or wounded. in addition, 34 indochinese assigned to the battalion were killed in action. on september 1, 1954, the regiment de corée was disbanded and reduced to battalion size. the battalion remained in indochina until july 17, 1955, when it embarked from saigon to algeria to participate in the suppression of the ongoing insurrection. on august 10, 1955, the battalion landed in algiers and began a series of garrison and search-and-destroy operations in the constantine department. on september 1, 1960, the battalion was amalgamated with the 156th infantry regiment () and received the designation of 156 régiment d\\'infanterie- régiment de corée. all told, the regiment suffered 48 killed in action in algeria. the regiment was repatriated to france after the évian accords and disbanded upon its return to france in 1962. see also united nations forces in the korean war medical support in the korean war military history of france french participation in the korean war forces françaises dans la guerre de corée references further reading the history of the un forces in the korean war-3 (belgium, colombia, france, greece, luxembourg, netherlands, denmark, italy, norway, sweden) - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 1974 (e-book) the history of the un forces in the korean war-3 (belgium, colombia, france, greece, luxembourg, netherlands, denmark, italy, norway, sweden) - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 1974 (pdf) the history of the un forces in the korean war-6 (summary) - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 1977 (e-book) the history of the un forces in the korean war-6 (summary) - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 1977 (pdf) the korean war and the un forces - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 2015 (e-book) the korean war and the un forces - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 2015 (pdf) the statistics of the korean war - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 2014 (e-book) the statistics of the korean war - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 2014 (pdf) the history of the un forces in the korean war - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 1998 (e-book) the history of the un forces in the korean war - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 1998 (pdf) the summary of the korean war - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 1986 (pdf) the history of the korean war-10: the un forces (australia, belgium, luxembourg, canada, colombia, ethiopia, france, greece, netherlands) - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 1980 (e-book) the history of the korean war-10: the un forces (australia, belgium, luxembourg, canada, colombia, ethiopia, france, greece, netherlands) - rok ministry of national defense institute for military history, 1980 (pdf) external links french army \"docrine\" magazine 11, april 2007 article called the un-assigned french battalion in korea french participation in the korean war un participation in the korean war - korean war educator souvenirs de corée avec le bataillon français de l\\'o.n.u. infantry battalions of france military units and formations of the first indochina war military history of france during the korean war french fourth republic france military units and formations established in 1950 military units and formations disestablished in 1953 battalions of the korean war france-korea relations france-united states relations',\n",
       " 'as a legal term, ground rent specifically refers to regular payments made by a holder of a leasehold property to the freeholder or a superior leaseholder, as required under a lease. in this sense, a ground rent is created when a freehold piece of land is sold on a long lease or leases. the ground rent provides an income for the landowner. in economics, ground rent is a form of economic rent meaning all value accruing to titleholders as a result of the exclusive ownership of title privilege to location. history in roman law, ground rent (solarium) was an annual rent payable by the lessee of a superficies (a piece of land), or perpetual lease of building land. in early norman england, tenants could lease their title to land so that the land-owning lords did not have any power over the sub-tenant to collect taxes. in 1290 king edward i passed the statute of quia emptores that prevented tenants from leasing their lands to others through subinfeudation. this created a system of substitution, where the tenant\\'s full interest would be transferred to the purchaser or donee, who would pay a rentcharge. this system later passed into common law in england and was adopted by many nations which trace their legal heritage to england. classical economists and georgists quantify ground rent to investigate and capture unearned income called economic rent, as distinct from income derived from labour. valuation the value of the freehold interest comprises: a multiple of the current annual ground rent payable, which will depend on the outstanding term of the lease any future scheduled increases in the level of ground rent market interest rates the probability of default if the rents for individual flats etc. are small, the cost of collection the net present value of the reversion, i.e. at the end of the lease the freeholder (to whom the rent is paid) will probably be fully entitled to the property, so the shorter the lease the greater the reversion value. any attributable \"marriage value\" (a substantial sum designed to compensate freeholders for their loss of interest when a lease with less than 80 years to run is extended). in economics, ground rent means all economic value accruing to owners of land, regardless of whether payments are explicitly made or the rents are imputed. various assessment methodologies are employed by real estate appraisers. united kingdom in the united kingdom, the rights of residential tenants of property subject to a long lease at a ground rent are governed by the leasehold reform act 1967 for houses and the leasehold reform, housing and urban development act 1993 for flats. england and wales in english law, it appears that the term \"ground rent\" was at one time popularly used for the houses and lands out of which ground rents issue, as well as for the rents themselves. lord eldon observed in 1815 that the context in which the term occurred may materially vary its meaning. the contemporary accepted meaning of ground rent is the rent at which land is let for the purpose of improvement by building: i.e. a rent charged in respect of the land only, and not in respect of the buildings to be placed on it. it is therefore usually lower than the rent that might be achieved for a building let on the open market, and is let for a longer termat least 21 years, but more commonly 99 years, 125 years, or even 999 years. the commonhold and leasehold reform act 2002 and associated regulations now govern the form of notice that needs to be issued to collect ground rent. previously there had been a problem with some landlords sending confusing or dishonest demands for payments to tenants. under the terms of a lease agreement, the freeholder (the outright owner of the land or property) grants permission for a leaseholder to take ownership of the property for a specified period of time. this could range from 21 years to 999 years, and during this time, the leaseholder will pay ground rent to the freeholder. freeholders lease property primarily for the initial premium paid by the original leaseholder for granting the lease; but in addition ground rent (often a token amount) will be payable over a long term, and this may be an attractive fixed income investment for some types of investor. the final sanction available to a landlord faced with a leaseholder in breach of the lease due to the failure to pay the service charges, ground rent or administration charges, is to forfeit the lease and to repossess the house or flat. to do this the landlord must first serve a valid notice under section 146 of the law of property act 1925 - a notice of seeking possession. however, the landlord cannot serve a section 146 notice where the amount of service charges, administration charges or ground rent owed (or a combination of all of these) unless the unpaid amount is more than £350 or consists of, or includes, an amount that has been outstanding for more than three years. there are a number of companies which specialise in buying ground rents for long term investment from landlords who want to sell their ground rents. normally they focus on purchasing reversionary ground rents, either for initial income or for the opportunity of a reversion of the underlying property at some point in the future. the value of ground rents is affected by the rent review pattern on future income increases, the value of the underlying property, the unexpired lease length, and whether marriage value is applicable. before selling ground rents, statute obliges the transactional parties to serve section v notices on the long leaseholders. this gives them a two-month period in which to respond. upon expiry of this, a transaction can proceed within 12 months at the price stated on the notice or higher. the only case in which such notices are irrelevant is for exchange of contracts on the sale and purchase of the ground rent of flats before 50% of them were sold. this then allows for the sum to pass and ground rent rights in return, even after all the flats are sold, without individual notices. however the rentcharge buyer is wise to note the pending contract on the freehold title. before 2003 the land registry recorded the ground rent, and the rent is evident from the register of title from their website. from 13 october 2003 the land registry no longer does so, and a more studied examination of the downloaded lease is needed. ground rent scandal in the past, ground rent was usually not onerous, at typically around £100 per year, and often freeholders would not request payment. but in the 2010s, developers and builders often granted leases for new homes with ground rents as high as £1000 per annum, with escalation clauses doubling them every 5 or 10 years. this can result in immediate and/or subsequent mortgage refusals from lenders and their valuers, which makes the property sellable below the market price. leaseholders have a right after two years to extend a lease with less than 99 years to run and reduce ground rent to a \"peppercorn\", i.e. close to zero, but developers have thwarted this with costly leases of more than 150 years that make the valuation - based on the ground rent and term - beyond the reach of leaseholders, and sell the freehold - often before the development is finished - to exploitative offshore companies. the english and welsh \"ground rent scandal\" has been widely reported in the press. in 2016 mp peter bottomley described excessive ground rents as \"legalised extortion\". in response to questions raised by the mp, communities secretary sajid javid said: \"we must make sure the kind of abuses he mentioned are stamped out and we will continue to do everything [we can]. we do work with a number of stakeholders and we can certainly see how we can do more.\" in june 2018 the uk government announced that leasehold tenure would be reformed, with new long leases having zero ground rent. this promise was fulfilled with the leasehold reform (ground rent) act 2022, which mostly prohibited ground rent greater than one peppercorn per year on new leases. scotland in scots law, the term \\'ground rent\\' is not employed, but its place is taken, for practical purposes, by the ground annual, which bears a double meaning: at the time of the reformation in scotland, the lands of the church were parcelled out by the crown into various lordships, the grantees being called \"lords of erection\". in the 17th century these lords of erection resigned their superiorities to the crown, with the exception of the feu-duties, which were to be retained until a price agreed upon for their redemption had been paid. this reserved power of redemption was, however, resigned by the crown on the eve of the union and the feu-duties became payable in perpetuity to the lords of erection as a ground annual. speculators in building ground usually granted sub-feus to builders at a high feu-duty. but where sub-feus were prohibited - they might have been prior to the conveyancing (scotland) act 1874 - and there is much demand for building ground, the feuars frequently stipulated that the builder pay an annual rent rather than purchase the land outright. this annual rent is called a ground annual. interest is not due on arrears of ground annuals and, like other real burdens, ground annuals could be freely assigned and conveyed. feu duty in scotland was ended by the abolition of feudal tenure etc. (scotland) act 2000. northern ireland redemption of ground rents in northern ireland is covered by the ground rents act (northern ireland) 2001. republic of ireland in the republic of ireland ground rents have been a feature of urban life. while most tenancy reform legislation has been enacted for agricultural land (see irish land acts), urban occupiers / tenants have been allowed to \"buy out\" their ground rents from landlords, and so effectively change a long lease into a freehold interest, most recently under acts of 1978 and 2005. notably, ground rents in castlebar, county mayo have been withheld following the controversial disappearance of lord lucan in 1974. netherlands ground leases () are common in the netherlands. however most dutch municipalities (including rotterdam, den bosch, eindhoven, haarlem, and maastricht) are currently abandoning the system, and offering householders the right to buy their plot of land. nonetheless, a number, including amsterdam, are retaining ground leases, which ease comprehensive redevelopment, prevent land speculation and mean that the entire community benefits from any increase in value of the land. on 1 july 2016 amsterdam introduced the option of permanent ground leases as well as temporary and continuous ground leases. householders had until 8 january 2020 to apply under advantageous terms to convert their ground lease to a perpetual basis, which means that it will indexed to inflation and will not rise unpredictably at the end of each term. diemen, hendrik-ido-ambacht, utrecht and vlaardingen (new rules in 2013) are also retaining ground rent. the hague introduced a new system of leasehold and ownership on 1 april 2008. householders can purchase their land at 5% of 55% of the value of built-up land to convert their perpetual leasehold into ownership. for larger office buildings and industrial buildings over 100 m and areas that do not yet have a current use, the ground lease remains in force. in the province of groningen a variant survives in which there is an everlasting right of leasehold, the (right of oppression). law and mortgages in the netherlands, ground lease is regulated by title 7 of book 5 of the dutch civil code. in many cases, long-term leaseholds become qualified indexed loans, creating tax benefits. since 2010, banks have been applying stricter rules when providing mortgages on residential leasehold properties. only new indefinite leases issued from 1 january 2013 are still eligible for a mortgage. these contracts must comply with the \"banking directive on financing lease rights\" of the dutch banking association. fixed-term contracts, for example 30 or 49 years, are excluded, while existing fixed-term contracts issued before 1 january 2013 are eligible for mortgage financing, provided the conditions meet the eligibility criteria of the dutch banking association. banks have decided to do this because they fear that the landowner will implement substantial increases, which will lead to payment problems for the leaseholder. owners of leasehold properties wishing to sell their house are increasingly confronted with this restriction. the house appears to be unsaleable in many cases because new prospective buyers cannot get the financing. united states the term \\'ground rent\\' is applied in many u.s. states to a kind of tenure created by a grant in fee simple, the grantor reserving to himself and his heirs a certain rent, which is the interest in the money value of the land. maryland the state of maryland maintains provisions for ground rents, primarily in the baltimore area. the practice dates back to the seventeenth century, when lesser lords and serfs paid crops and livestock to feudal lords to rent the lord\\'s land. with ground rent, homeowners only own the building itself, but they must pay a small amount to rent the land itself from its owner. under maryland law, if ground rent is not paid on time, the ground owner can go to court and have a lien placed against the house, effectively seizing the home from the homeowner over a relatively small amount due, sometimes as little as $24. this occurred almost 4,000 times in baltimore city from 2000 to 2005. in addition, properties with ground rent are usually valued about $10,000 less than comparable properties without ground rent. in 2007, an emergency bill was presented by democratic governor of maryland martin o\\'malley to completely ban new ground rents and prevent ground owners from seizing houses from delinquent homeowners. the bill was passed by the legislature. maryland state law required all ground owners to register the ownership of the land with the state by september 2008 or else the ground ownership is automatically extinguished. as of 2008, there were about 85,000 in maryland. the new laws were contested in court for some ground owners, who called it an unconstitutional taking of property without fair compensation. in 2011, the law was ruled unconstitutional by the maryland court of appeals, the state\\'s highest court, to the extent that it purported to extinguish property rights of leaseholders. new ground rent leases can no longer be created after 22 january 2007, and ground rent owners must register their leases with the state department of assessments in order to collect rents or file a lien for unpaid rents (although failure to register no longer risks extinguishment of the property right). new york more than a hundred condominium and co-op buildings exist on leased land in new york city, including notable high-rises like trump plaza and the stanhope. many date to the 1960s and 1970s, before the city became one of the world\\'s most expensive real estate markets. apartments in land-lease buildings tend to cost \"25 ... to 40 percent\" less than comparable units in buildings on owned land, according to one new york city property broker, but their \"perceived risk\" may cause difficulty selling or financing them. monthly costs include rent payments for the land, so they are significantly higher than fees in an owned building, and can rise sharply and unexpectedly if the land\\'s value is reassessed during a real estate boom. theoretically, the expiration of a land lease could even turn shareholders/owners to tenants and render their investments worthless. pennsylvania ground rents in the commonwealth of pennsylvania are considered real estate and, in cases of intestacy, go to the heirs. they are rent services and not rent charges, the statute quia emptores never having been in force in pennsylvania, and are subject to all the incidents of such rents. the grantee of a ground rent may mortgage, sell, or otherwise dispose of the grant as he pleases, and while the rent is paid the land cannot be sold or the value of the improvements lost. the owner of land can occupy it, or can improve it and sell the improvements (such as structures), while retaining title to the land, and charge the buyer ground rent. since ground rent was a freehold estate, created by deed, and perpetual in duration, no presumption that it had been released could, at common law, arise from lapse of time. however, by statute (act of 27 april 1855, s. 7), a presumption of release or extinguishment is created where no payment, claim, or demand has been made for the rent, nor any declaration or acknowledgment of its existence made or given by the owner of the premises subject to it, for a period of twenty-one years. ground rents were formerly irredeemable after a certain time, but the creation of irredeemable ground rents is now forbidden (pennsylvania act 7 assembly, 22 april 1850). virginia the commonwealth of virginia permits residential ground rents, which are defined by statute: (the obligor is the party obliged to pay, and the obligee the party entitled to receive, the ground rent.) the amount of a ground rent may be changed by either party once every five years, but, unless the parties agree otherwise, the amount of such a change may be no greater than the percentage change in the consumer price index (or other standard prescribed by statute) during the previous three years. a ground rent constitutes a lien against the real estate. the terms of the ground rent agreement may be incorporated into the deed or other instrument of transfer, according to a statutory form. references external links uk rentcharges act 1977 at propertylawuk.net the

       " 't. b. blackstone memorial library is a building that is part of the chicago public library system and is named after timothy blackstone. the building was designed by chicago architect solon s. beman. it is now known as the chicago public library - blackstone branch and commonly referred to as blackstone library, or blackstone branch and sometimes blackstone for short. the concord granite building\\'s two-year construction started in 1902, and it was dedicated on january 8, 1904. blackstone library marks the beginning of the chicago branch library system as the first dedicated branch in the system. blackstone is also the only branch of the 79-branch chicago public library branch system that was constructed using private funding. the blackstone library was designated as a chicago landmark. the building is located in chicago\\'s kenwood community area in cook county, illinois, united states and serves the hyde park, kenwood, and oakland community areas. the branch celebrated its 100th anniversary of service in 2004. today, the library has bronze and mahogany furnishings and has themed paintings on the rotunda ceiling. the library is equipped with custom-designed furniture and makes public wi-fi access available to its patrons. history the library was dedicated to the memory of timothy beach blackstone, president of the chicago and alton railroad from 1864 to 1899, a period longer than any of his contemporaries. blackstone, who had died on may 26, 1900, was also the founding president of the union stock yards. he had owned the property on which the blackstone library now stands, and he donated this tract for the construction of the library after his death. the library was built on the tract through a codicil in his will, carried out by his wife, isabella norton blackstone (1838-1928), after his death. blackstone library was his contribution to the city where he had made his fortune and stands as a monument to his generosity. blackstone is and its original cost was $250,000 ($ today). although the blackstones lived downtown, they maintained numerous close friendships in the affluent hyde park and kenwood neighborhoods. prior to the donation of the blackstone library, the chicago public library system had been renting reading room spaces around the city and had been seeking stand alone branches. on january 8, 1904, isabella blackstone handed the keys and deed to the timothy b. blackstone library to the city\\'s library board members. blackstone library became the first branch library in the chicago public library system. the building retains a lake park avenue address although the neighboring section of lake park was moved about a half a block east several decades ago. at least three renovations have occurred, which have expanded, renovated and updated the library. from 1938 to 1939 the new children\\'s room annex, a works progress administration project, was added at a cost of $68,400 ($). during this annexation one of a set of howard van doren shaw townhouses was razed. from 1977 to 1980 a major restorative renovation occurred. blackstone was rededicated on november 18, 1980, in recognition of completion of the three years of work. there was also a 2004 renovation for the centennial. blackstone donated a larger james blackstone memorial library (1891, opened 1893), in his father\\'s memory to branford, connecticut, blackstone\\'s birthplace. in addition to the james blackstone library in branford, there is a library named \"blackstone library\" in blackstone, ma. the architect for both the branford and chicago libraries was solon s. beman. the blackstone library was designated as a chicago landmark by the city of chicago on december 8, 2010. service as one of the 79 chicago public library branch libraries, blackstone library serves the hyde park, kenwood, and oakland community areas. these communities include 17 elementary schools and 4 high schools. the 2000 census service area population was 50,084. in 2003, the \"friends of blackstone branch library\" was formed, making the blackstone branch one of approximately 34 branches to have such a support group. the volunteer support group attempts to \"serve as an advisory council for chicago\\'s first branch library, promote use and improvement of the library, and provide volunteer and fundraising services for blackstone\". the blackstone library participates in most chicago public library programs and partnerships, including great kids museum passport program, the monthly adult book club discussion as well as many annual events and activities. the branch also partners with neighborhood institutions such as the hyde park art center and the smart museum for programs and workshops. like all branches, the library provides both free wi-fi access and free terminals with both internet access and printing facilities. blackstone has 5 internet terminals requiring reservations for each session of up to one hour and 1 express terminal that does not require reservations for sessions of up to 15 minutes. currently, patrons can use the terminals for up to two free internet sessions per day and print for a small charge per page anywhere in the chicago public library system. design the building was designed by the architect solon s. beman and modeled after beman\\'s merchant tailors building, the domed temple facing the lagoon in the 1893 world\\'s columbian exposition, and the erechtheum at the athenian acropolis. greek mythology teaches that demeter, the goddess, bestowed agriculture and civilization upon the world during erechtheus\\'s reign. the library\\'s rotunda murals have thematic titles: \"labor\", \"literature\", \"art\" and \"science\". the following is a summary of the building\\'s features: tiffany style dome; marble column and walls in the rotunda and foyer; 4 overhead rotunda murals painted by oliver dennett grover, mural painter for the world columbian exposition; square italian marble mosaic flooring; glass-floored mezzanine; bronze plate, solid copper core outer front doors; 2 lbs. bronze and glass inner doors; thick granite walls; and ionic columns. the building\\'s adult reading room is equipped with mahogany furniture specifically designed for the space. it also contains matching built-in shelving and custom-made bronze lamps. the circulation desk area has two-tiered bronze-trimmed book stacks. the mezzanine floor is composed of glass blocks. related structures and ways although parts of south blackstone avenue south of 53rd street accommodate two-way traffic, near the library it is a northbound street that accommodates one-way traffic running north along the 1436 east block and ending immediately to the west of (behind) the blackstone library at 4900 south

       " 'david t. prosser jr. (born december 24, 1942) is an american jurist and politician who served as speaker of the wisconsin state assembly from 1995 to 1996, and as a justice of the wisconsin supreme court from 1998 to 2016. he is currently an advisor to wisconsin assembly speaker robin vos as vos seeks a rationale for impeaching current wisconsin supreme court justice janet protasiewicz. following his graduation from university of wisconsin law school, prosser worked in washington as an attorney at the u.s. department of justice and as an aide to u.s. representative harold vernon froehlich. returning to wisconsin, he began a private practice, worked as a district attorney for two years, then served 18 years as a republican party legislator in the wisconsin state assembly. he was the state house minority leader for six of those years and speaker of the assembly for two years. after an unsuccessful bid for the u.s. house in 1996, prosser was appointed by wisconsin governor tommy thompson to a vacant seat on the state tax appeals board, then in 1998 to a vacant seat on wisconsin supreme court. he was elected to his first 10-year term without opposition in 2001. he ran for reelection in april 2011 against little-known wisconsin assistant attorney general joanne kloppenburg. the race received national attention and was viewed as a referendum on efforts by republican governor scott walker and the republican-controlled legislature to curb the union rights of public workers in wisconsin. the april 5, 2011, election was too close to call until two days later when the waukesha county clerk announced she had erroneously omitted more than 14,000 votes from her earlier tally. the additional votes gave prosser a lead of over 7,000 which was sustained by a later recount. prosser received media attention in 2010 following verbal altercations with the chief justice of the wisconsin supreme court, and also in june 2011 when allegations were made of a physical altercation between prosser and fellow associate justice ann walsh bradley that occurred in connection with the union-curbing bill. a special prosecutor investigated but declined to press criminal charges. an ethics action against prosser was recommended by the wisconsin judicial commission, however, after three other justices recused themselves from the matter, no further action was taken. prosser returned to the spotlight in september 2023, when he emerged as an advisor to wisconsin assembly speaker robin vos in his attempts to find a rationale to impeach the newest wisconsin supreme court justice, janet protasiewicz. early life and education prosser was born in chicago, illinois, to david t. prosser sr. and his wife elizabeth (patterson) prosser, and was raised in appleton, wisconsin. after graduating from appleton high school, he attended depauw university, receiving his b.a. in 1965. he went on to law school at the university of wisconsin and received his j.d. in 1968. career early career prosser lectured at indiana university-indianapolis law school from 1968 to 1969, before working from 1969 to 1972 in washington, d.c., as an attorney advisor in the office of criminal justice, u.s. department of justice. he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the wisconsin state assembly in 1972, then served as an administrative assistant to u.s. representative harold vernon froehlich. froehlich was a republican and a former speaker of the wisconsin state assembly, serving his first term in the u.s. house of representatives. as a member of the house judiciary committee during the watergate impeachment hearings, in the 1973-1974 term, he was one of the few republicans who voted in favor of impeaching richard nixon. froehlich lost re-election in the democratic wave of 1974. prosser returned to wisconsin and, after two years in private practice as a self-employed lawyer, he was elected outagamie county district attorney in the 1976 election, serving from 1977 to 1978. wisconsin legislature prosser represented the appleton area in the wisconsin state assembly as a republican from 1979 through 1996. his committee assignments included criminal justice and public safety and judiciary. during his tenure in the assembly, he served six years as minority leader and two years as speaker. in 1981, he opposed removing criminal penalties on sexual activity and cohabitation between unmarried, consulting adults, though he did express a willingness to repeal the jail terms. he stated that legalizing sex outside of marriage would increase divorce rates, the number of children born outside of wedlock, welfare payments, sexually transmitted diseases, and abortions. in 1995, while he was assembly speaker, prosser led the push for the new baseball stadium for the milwaukee brewers, saying that wisconsin had a choice of being either a \"big league or bush league\" state. campaign for u.s. congress in 1996 he ran for the 8th congressional district seat in the u.s. congress vacated by retiring u.s. representative toby roth. prosser won what the milwaukee journal sentinel described as a \"bitter and high-spending\" primary, but was defeated in the general election by democrat jay w. johnson. one month later, governor thompson appointed prosser to the wisconsin tax appeals commission where he conducted hearings and ruled on disputes related to state taxation. wisconsin supreme court in september 1998, thompson appointed prosser to a vacant seat on the wisconsin supreme court, hailing him as a conservative. in an unusual move, a bipartisan group of 77 of the 132 state legislators sent a letter to thompson supporting the appointment, describing prosser as, \"learned, thoughtful, and fiercely defensive of our system of law\". in 2011, the milwaukee journal sentinel said prosser is a \"reliable judicial conservative, but he\\'s also independent\", citing an august 2010 wisconsin law journal analysis which concluded \"prosser voted with no justice more than 85% of the time, though he generally combined with three other conservative justices (michael gableman, patience roggensack, and annette ziegler), to form a 4-3 majority on the court. the new york times said some observers believe that prosser is a member of a conservative 4-3 bloc on the court. in october 2010, prosser indicated that he supported limiting free online access to wisconsin trial court records because the information can be misused by employers and landlords, saying, \"some people are actually innocent, and they shouldn\\'t be disadvantaged forever\" by the online records. opponents of the change argued that restricting free online access may result in private vendors selling the information, and may conflict with wisconsin\\'s open records law. following the decision in donohoo v. action wisconsin inc., prosser voted to amend the state\\'s judicial code of conduct to allow judges to decide cases involving their campaign contributors, saying there are various levels of support and a campaign contribution or endorsement \"in and of itself does not create so close or special relationship so as to require automatic recusal.\" he has also said his policy is not to recuse himself from cases involving lawmakers he has served with in the past unless the case is actually about the lawmakers. prosser retired from the wisconsin supreme court on july 31, 2016. other professional activities prosser served as a member of the wisconsin council of criminal justice (1980-1983), the judicial council commission on preliminary examinations (1981), the wisconsin sentencing commission (1984-1988, 1994-1995), the wisconsin sesquicentennial commission (1993-1999), and the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws (1983-1996). controversies decision not to prosecute abuse case in 1978, while serving as district attorney of outagamie county, prosser declined to prosecute a catholic priest accused of sexual abuse by two brothers (ages 12 and 14), who said the priest had touched their chests and unsuccessfully attempted to touch lower. prosser later explained he did not file charges because the case was weak; it involved relatively new sexual assault laws that were untested at the time, and he did not think he could win a jury trial. he said he had assumed the priest, john patrick feeney, would be reassigned as a result of his discussion with feeney\\'s bishop. the priest was not removed from duties which allowed him contact with children, and he went on to abuse other children before being sent to prison on a 15-year sentence in 2004. the prosecutor who ultimately and successfully prosecuted the case in the early 2000s said that when prosser had the case in the 1970s, he was lacking sufficient information: \"we were able to gather a wealth of information that far exceeded what prosser had,\" he said, adding, \"it\\'s not fair to second-guess him now.\" when interviewed in 2011 one of the victims said that in 1978 he and his brother had not communicated detailed information about the abuse to the authorities, and that when the case came to trial in 2002, prosser helped in the prosecution. during prosser\\'s 2011 run for re-election to the wisconsin supreme court, the incident was revived in a political ad by a pro-union organization which claimed that prosser did not investigate the abuse allegations and participated in a coverup. the ad was ultimately rated \"mostly false\" by the fact-checking website, politifact.com, which concluded that the ad omitted critical facts and created false impressions. one of the abuse victims, who had been critical of prosser\\'s decision not to prosecute, criticized the ad as \"offensive, inaccurate and out of context.\" prosser asked his opponent, kloppenburg, to call for the removal of the ad—she replied that the first amendment gave the group the right to run such ads. assembly staffers used for campaigning in 2006, prosser testified on behalf of wisconsin state representative scott jensen who was being tried on three felony counts of misconduct in office because his legislative staffers also performed campaign activity on his behalf. prosser stated that during seven years of his own tenure in the wisconsin assembly, he had used his taxpayer-funded staff for campaigning—the same crime jensen was eventually convicted of. prosser was not charged, and defended the actions saying, \"it was a different era and public expectations were quite different\". however critics described this as illegal activity, and the appleton post crescent, prosser\\'s hometown paper, found prosser\\'s admissions sufficient reason to endorse prosser\\'s opponent in the 2011 election, saying prosser fell short of having the \"unimpeachable integrity\" required of a high court judge because he had admittedly \"condoned illegal activity\" while serving as an elected official. altercations with other justices during a closed-door debate between the justices on february 10, 2010, prosser called chief justice shirley abrahamson \"a total bitch\" and threatened to \"destroy her\". a review of emails by the milwaukee journal sentinel indicated that \"justices on both sides described the court as dysfunctional, and prosser and others suggested bringing in a third party for help\". the 2010 conflict on the court was also criticized as having a potential for lowering court productivity and distracting the focus of the justices. prosser admitted he overreacted, but justified his statements, saying he had been goaded, bullied and abused by two other justices for a long time, and that the fights were caused by liberal members of the court \"ganging up\" on him and attempting to create a \"foul atmosphere\". he also said the march 2011 revelations of the year-old altercation were an attempt to hurt his bid for re-election. when interviewed in march 2011, justice ann walsh bradley acknowledged prosser had had outbursts over the years, but said there had not been one of significant magnitude since february 2010. she also commented that, \"he is a good man - but you cannot accurately say he has a steady, even temperament.\" conflicting media reports on june 25, 2011 indicated that prosser had gotten into an altercation with bradley on june 13, 2011 in her office, which allegedly became physical. the dispute occurred during a discussion in bradley\\'s office with four other justices present, before the court issued its june 13, 2011 split decision to uphold the law limiting collective bargaining rights for most wisconsin state public employees. in one report, witnesses alleged that after bradley told prosser to leave her office, prosser grabbed bradley around the neck in what was described as a chokehold. prosser claimed that bradley charged prosser with her fist raised, and that in attempting to block her, he made contact with her neck. capitol police chief charles tubbs was notified of the incident, and met with the entire supreme court. investigations into the matter were opened by the wisconsin judicial commission and the dane county sheriff\\'s office. after initially saying he would refrain from comment until a proper investigation was completed, prosser denied he choked bradley saying, \"claims made to the media will be proven false.\" bradley then made a public statement saying that prosser, \"put his hands around my neck in anger in a chokehold\", as she was asking him to leave her office. the dane county sheriff\\'s office gave its findings to county district attorney ismael ozanne, who referred the matter to special prosecutor patricia barrett; barrett ultimately ruled in late august 2011 that the circumstances and evidence reviewed did not support the filing of criminal charges. on march 16, 2012, the wisconsin judicial commission filed an ethics complaint against prosser, \"recommending that the court discipline him for alleged misconduct\", however, three conservative members of the court recused themselves from the matter, with the result that no quorum existed, and no decision could be made. failure to recuse during \"john doe\" probe of scott walker leaked files obtained by the guardian revealed that a network of dark money groups spent $3.5 million to pay for tv and radio ads backing the judge during his 2011 campaign. according to these leaked emails \"the push was seen as vital, the documents disclose, as a means of retaining the rightwing majority of the court and thereby preserving the anti-union measures introduced by walker. \\'if we lose [justice prosser], the walker agenda is toast,\\' one ally writes in an email sent around to the governor\\'s chief of staff and several conservative lobbyists.\" in 2015, a john doe probe into scott walker\\'s funding sources during the 2012 recall campaign against him involved the same set groups that funded prosser\\'s 2011 campaign. despite the obvious possible conflicts of interest, prosser refused to recuse himself, ultimately casting the deciding vote to terminate the probe. prosser told the guardian that four years had passed since his re-election before he joined the decision to close the john doe investigation, over which time any potential conflict of interest had faded. advising republican leadership regarding impeachment in fall 2023, prosser was included in a special panel to advise wisconsin assembly speaker robin vos on the question of impeaching the newest wisconsin supreme court justice, janet protasiewicz. this followed several weeks of acrimony as vos threatened impeachment to prevent the justice from participating in pending redistricting cases. prosser\\'s opinion on the matter became known through an october 6 letter to the speaker, which read: 2011 re-election campaign prosser faced joanne kloppenburg, a long-time but little-known wisconsin assistant attorney general, in both the february 5, 2011, spring primary, and the april 5 run-off election. primary election in december 2010, prosser\\'s campaign director expressed strong support for governor-elect walker, saying prosser\\'s \"personal ideology more closely mirrors\" walker\\'s, and that a win by prosser would result in, \"protecting the conservative judicial majority and acting as a common sense complement to both the new administration and legislature.\" he later disavowed the statements and claimed he had not seen the release. prosser\\'s campaign manager also said that, \"this election is about a 4-3 commonsense conservative majority vs. a 3-4 liberal majority, and nothing more.\" in a survey of attorneys conducted by the milwaukee bar association that was published february 2011, prosser received more votes saying he was \"qualified\" than any of his opponents; besting kloppenburg by a margin of 296 to 112. he was endorsed in the milwaukee journal sentinel, and the sun prairie star. he won the primary handily, receiving 231,000 votes to second-place finisher kloppenburg\\'s 105,000 votes; a 30% margin. general election in the general election of april 5, 2011, prosser again faced kloppenburg. the contest received considerable attention due to the 2011 wisconsin protests of walker\\'s budget repair bill and limitations on public employee bargaining rights; issues which would likely soon come before the wisconsin supreme court. kloppenburg supporters attempted to tie prosser to the policies of republican governor scott walker, and his march 2011 law limiting most of wisconsin\\'s public employees\\' collective bargaining rights. the non-partisan race for the court seat was also characterized as a proxy battle or referendum on the administration of governor walker and other republican officials. both candidates stated their unhappiness regarding the increased partisan aspect of the race, with prosser claiming that if he was defeated, it would mean the end of judicial independence. on march 31, prosser\\'s campaign co-chair, former democratic governor patrick lucey, resigned from the campaign and endorsed kloppenburg, saying it appeared that prosser had lost his impartiality, and was showing \"a disturbing distemper and lack of civility that does not bode well for the high court\". the wausau daily herald reversed its primary election endorsement, and urged its readers to vote against prosser in the general, describing him as \"an intemperate figure given to partisan rhetoric\". citing the earlier statement of prosser\\'s campaign director that the election is about maintaining a conservative majority on the court, the capital times endorsed kloppenburg. prosser was endorsed by the sun prairie star, the milwaukee journal-sentinel, and former alaska governor sarah palin (via twitter), among others for the general election. state officials predicted a voter turnout of around 20 percent, a typical level of turnout for an april election. however, voter interest and turnout were unusually high with nearly 1.5 million votes cast. result the day after the election, kloppenburg was thought to be ahead by a razor-thin margin of 204-votes, leading her to prematurely declare victory. late in the afternoon of april 7, waukesha county clerk kathy nickolaus announced that the preliminary vote totals she had given to the associated press on april 6 did not include 14,315 votes from brookfield, her county\\'s second largest city and one of the most republican. the announcement changed the unofficial total, giving prosser a lead of over 7,000 votes which likely would not be changed by a recount. other, much smaller errors in the preliminary count were found in other counties favoring both candidates. a final vote canvass of all the counties in wisconsin gave prosser an official lead of 7,316 votes on april 15. kloppenburg did request a recount at taxpayer expense (costing as much as $500,000) and prosser was eventually declared the winner by 7,006 votes. new york times analyst nate silver declared on april 8 that nickolaus\\' error pointed to incompetence, not conspiracy. however, democrats called on nickolaus to resign, citing her previous employment under prosser in the mid-1990s as a member of the assembly caucus and questions about her procedures and counts in prior elections. state election officials announced an investigation of possible voting irregularities going back to 2006. electoral history references external links the 118-page police dossier on the july 13 incident released in august 2011, a

       " 'homelessness in china is a significant social issue. in 2011, there were approximately 2.41 million homeless adults and 179,000 homeless children living in the country. however, one publication estimated that there were one million homeless children in china in 2012. causes in 2015, it was reported that there are more than 3 million people are homeless in china. housing in china is highly regulated by the hukou system. this gives rise to a large number of migrant workers, numbering at 290.77 million in 2019. these migrant workers have rural hukou, but they move to the cities in order to find better jobs, though due to their rural hukou they are entitled to fewer privileges than those with urban hukou. according to huili et al., these migrant workers \"live in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions\" and are always at risk of displacement to make way for new real estate developments. in 2017, the government responded to a deadly fire in a crowded building in beijing by cracking down on dense illegal shared accommodations and evicting the residents, leaving many migrant laborers homeless. this comes in the context of larger attempts by the government to limit the population increase in beijing, often targeting migrant laborers. however, according to official government statistics, migrant workers in china have an average of of living space per capita, and the vast majority of migrant workers have basic living facilities such as heating, bathing, refrigerators, and washing machines. several natural disasters have led to homelessness in china. the 2000 yunnan earthquake left 92,479 homeless and destroyed over 41,000 homes. homelessness among people with mental health problems is \\'much less common\\' in china than in high-income countries, due to stronger family ties, but is increasing due to migration within families and as a result of the one-child policy. a study in xiangtan found at least 2439 schizophrenic people that have been homeless on a total population of 2.8 million. it was found that \"homelessness was more common in individuals from rural communities (where social support services are limited), among those who wander away from their communities (i.e., those not from xiangtan municipality), and among those with limited education (who are less able to mobilize social supports). homelessness was also associated with greater age; [the cause] may be that older patients have ‘burned their bridges\\' with relatives and, thus, end up on the streets.\" during the cultural revolution a large part of child welfare homes were closed down, leaving their inhabitants homeless. by the late 1990s, many new homes were set up to accommodate abandoned children. in 1999, the ministry of civil affairs estimated the number of abandoned children in welfare homes to be 66,000. efforts to assist the homeless according to the ministry of civil affairs, china had approximately 2,000 shelters and 20,000 social workers to aid approximately 3 million homeless people in 2014. from 2017 to 2019, the government of guangdong province assisted 5,388 homeless people in reuniting with relatives elsewhere in china. according to actual news, homeless people are deported out of the cities to rural areas to be out of sight. sometimes for distances of about 1000 miles, their whereabouts and wellbeing unknown. the guangdong government assisted more than 150,000 people over a three-year period. in 2020, in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, the chinese ministry of civil affairs announced several actions of the central committee in response to homelessness, including increasing support services and reuniting homeless people with their families. in wuhan, the situation for homeless people was particularly bad, as the lockdown made it impossible for homeless migrants to return to other parts of the country. the wuhan civil affairs bureau set up 69 shelters in the city to house 4,843 people. references external links china poverty in china',\n",

       " 'long-range aviation (, literally aviation of distant action and abbreviated da, is a sub-branch of the russian aerospace forces responsible for delivering long-range nuclear or conventional strikes by aircraft (rather than missiles). the branch was previously part of the soviet air forces and russian air force tasked with long-range bombardment of strategic targets with nuclear weapons. during the cold war, the long-range aviation of the air forces (da vs) was the rough soviet equivalent to the french air force\\'s forces aériennes stratégiques (1964-present); the british raf bomber command (1936-68); and the united states air force (usaf) strategic air command (1946-1992). in the early 2020s there are roughly-equivalent structures within the people\\'s liberation army air force and in the usaf air force global strike command. long-range aviation traces its history to the aviation of distant action, aдд, or add, авиация дальнего действия, and the 18th air army of the second world war and beforehand. this article sketches the development of soviet and russian long-range bomber forces from their origins in the mid-1930s. origins, 1936-1940 the first three air armies, designated air armies of specific purpose (or particular purpose) were created between 1936 and 1938. in accordance with the predominant deep operations doctrine, the red army was reorganized into six echelons, of which the long-range aviation was the 1st echelon. the 2nd echelon consisted of: heavy tanks; the 3rd echelon: medium and light tanks; the 4th echelon: the motorised infantry; the 5th echelon: heavy artillery; and the 6th echelon comprised the main force: the rifle troops, with their own integral tank support. the 1st specific purpose air army was formed on 8 january 1936 as 1st air army of the general reserve command (specific purpose army - 1) (1-я авиационная армия резерва главного командования (ргк) (аон - 1)) headquartered at monino airfield. the initial to&e established by the general staff included two heavy-bomber air brigades (of tupolev tb-3), one fast-bomber air brigade (of tupolev sb) and one fighter air brigade. as the ilyushin db-3 entered service, they formed long-range bomber squadrons. the 2nd air army was created on 15 march 1937 in the far east, headquartered in khabarovsk. the 3rd air army was created on 21 may 1938 in the north caucasus military district, headquartered in rostov-on-don. on 20 october 1939 the three air armies\\' order of battle included: 1st specific purpose army (monino) 27th aviation brigade at monino (9th air base) 21st and the 53rd long range bomber air regiments 13th aviation brigade at migalovo (24th air base) 41st fast bomber air regiment and 6th long range bomber air regiment at ivanovo (12th air base) 2nd specific purpose army (voronezh) 64th aviation brigade at voronezh (112th air base) 7th and the 42nd long range bomber air regiments 30th aviation brigade at kursk (115th air base) 51st fast bomber air regiment and 45th long range bomber air regiment at oryol (141st air base) 3rd specific purpose army (rostov-on-don) 3rd aviation brigade at rostov-on-don (12th air base) 1st heavy bomber air regiment and 12th long range bomber air regiment at novocherkassk (7th air base) 7th aviation brigade at zaporizhia (16th air base) 8th and 11th long range bomber air regiments on 5 november 1940 the three specific purpose air armies were disbanded, due to their poor combat performance during the winter war with finland. the three armies were restructured as an integrated: long-range bomber aviation of the stavka, the red army supreme command (дальнебомбардировочная авиация главного командования красной армии (дба гк)). the structure now comprised: five air corps, three separate air divisions and one separate air regiment. second world war the crews of the dba gk performed their first combat sorties on june 22, 1941, bombing enemy troop concentrations in the suwalki and przemysl areas. on june 23, long-range bombers together with soviet naval aviation bombed danzig, koenigsberg, warsaw, krakow, and bucharest. on the night of august 10-11 of the same year, naval aviation bombers of the baltic fleet and 81st heavy bomber aviation division dba gk launched an air strike on the capital of the reich, the city of berlin. in the difficult initial period of the war, the centralized control principal of the dba gk was violated, large losses of aircraft and crews, and formations were constantly reorganised. the forces of the dba of the red army civil code were divided into small groups, as a result, 74% of all aircraft sorties were lone rangers, for 1941, were produced with the aim of directly supporting the troops on the battlefield, which was not the force\\'s main purpose. in august 1941, the supreme high command had to abolish the corps link command and control from the dba gk, since the loss of forces reached 65% of the original composition in june of the same year, and in the active army only seven air divisions remained. the state of affairs in the dba gk, by the beginning of 1942, left much to be desired, therefore, in order to preserve the forces of the dba gk, centralize their control, and ensure their massive use by the vgk, they decided and created long-range aviation (add), as a separate branch of the air force, by the decree of the state defence committee, dated march 5, 1942 in order to carry out strategically important tasks: bombing strikes on administrative-political and military targets deep behind enemy lines; violations of enemy transport communications; destruction of warehouses in the near rear; bombardment of the enemy on the front line to support strategic operations. in addition, the add (including the civil air fleet, gvf, which is part of it) was widely used to provide partisan movement both on occupied territory of the ussr, and in yugoslavia, czechoslovakia and poland, and performing special tasks, such as delivery of intelligences, reconnaissance and reconnaissance and sabotage groups, providing assistance to the resistance in axis-occupied europe and many others. formations of the add were allocated from the red army air force directly subordinate to the headquarters of the supreme commander-in-chief (svgk). eight long-range bomber aviation division, several airfields with a hard surface were transferred to long-range aviation, and a control, recruitment, logistics and repair system independent of the red army air force was created. long-range aviation at that time consisted of more than 1300 tb-3, tb-7 and il-4 bombers. in 1941, lra headquarters moved into the petrovsky palace in moscow. on 5 march 1942, stavka reorganized the long-range bomber aviation as an autonomous force: the long-range aviation (авиация дальнего действия (адд)), under the command of alexander golovanov. the force remained directly subordinate to stavka and independent of the mainstream vvs-pvo. its focus was strategic: bombing missions on administrative, political and military targets deep in the enemy\\'s rear; disruption of enemy transport networks; destruction of enemy logistics hubs, beyond the tactical front; and specialist strategic missions. the core of this specialist bomber-force was the long-range ilyushin il-4 bomber, though petlyakov pe-8s and other aircraft were also used. later, the mobilized civil air fleet was added to the add. this large and experienced transport force was widely used to support guerrillas deep in the occupied territory of the ussr. some missions later extended the support to include the partizans of yugoslavia. throughout its existence, the add was part of the reserve of the supreme high command (rvgk) and took its orders from the supreme commander, iosef stalin. during the battle of stalingrad, the add, having taken crippling losses over the past 18 months, was restricted to flying at night. the soviets flew 11,317 night sorties over stalingrad and the don bend sector between 17 july and 19 november 1942. these raids caused little damage and were of nuisance value only. the five long-range bomber corps had, at various times, nearly 3000 aircraft, of which 1800 were combat aircraft. the heavy bombers struck the cities of danzig, königsberg, kraków, berlin, helsinki, tallinn and others. the add took an active part in the operations in the baltic states. on 9 march 1944 between 1500 and 2000 explosive incendiary bombs were dropped on residential areas of tallinn. results of two soviet air raids: 40% of the buildings in the city destroyed, 463 dead, 649 injured and about 20,000 left without shelter. harju street was especially hard hit, along with the theater \"estonia\", where a concert had just started. from 6 to 8 march 1944 the historical part of narva was virtually wiped out; in the same month tartu, tapa and jõhvi were also bombed. in the period july-december 1944, the add made more than 7,200 sorties, dropping about 62,000 bombs with a total weight of 7,600 tons. 18th air army on 6 december 1944, the add was disbanded as an autonomous force and integrated into the red army air force. however, it retained its identity and role as the 18th air army (vozdushnaya armiya va). the composition of 18th air army included: headquarters 1st guards smolensk long-range bomber air corps 2nd guards bryansk long-range bomber aviation corps 3rd guards stalingrad long-range bomber aviation corps 4th guards gomel long-range bomber aviation corps 6th long-range aviation corps 19th long-range bomber aviation corps (until february 1945) four separate bomber aviation divisions 62nd air division long range long-range aviation of the air forces from 1946 after the second world war, strategic bombers were regrouped within the long-range aviation of the armed forces (da vs) in april 1946. the 7th air army in the west was reorganised as a long-range air army, the 3rd air army da. the da vs (dal\\'naya aviatsiya vozdushnikh syl - long range aviation of air forces) consisted of: the 1st air army da in smolensk, commanded by colonel-general of aviation nikolai papivin (:ru:папивин,_николай_филиппович) the 2nd air army da in vinnitsa; the 3rd air army da in khabarovsk; the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd air armies had established a reputation during the second world war, for their work of direct tactical support to the red army ground forces. therefore on 15 february 1949, the 1st air army da was redesignated the 50th air army; the 2nd air army da as the 43rd air army; and the 3rd air army da in the far east the 65th air army. as the 1940s closed and the cold war dawned, the soviet union scrambled to develop an instrument that could strike the united states. the only substantial aircraft that it was equipped with was the tupolev tu-4 (ascc \"bull\"), an exact copy of the boeing b-29 superfortress. this was fielded in 1949, and brought the first threat of attack to the united states, as missile technology at this time was still a decade away. however, the tu-4 was incapable of returning to the soviet union, and the soviet aircraft industry worked to develop an aircraft capable of round-trip operation. the outcome of this competition was the highly successful tupolev tu-95, which entered service in the 1955-1956 period, and remained the backbone of soviet air power against nato for many decades. it continues in service with the russian federation. myasischev\\'s contribution was the myasishchev m-4, but this aircraft fell below expectations. it surprisingly went on to serve an unexpected but vital role as the 3m aerial refueling tanker, which extended the reach of the strategic air fleet. other aircraft in service with the da during this period included the tupolev tu-22 (ascc blinder). in 1954, the first soviet long-range jet bomber tupolev tu-16 (ascc badger) entered service with long-range aviation. as of january 1, 1955, long-range aviation had 30 heavy bomber regiments, which were part of: two regiments(?) on tu-16 bombers (54 aircraft with a staff of 130 aircraft); ten heavy bomber aviation regiments on the tu-4 (63-94 aircraft in the division, 100% completed). one division on the tu-16 (43 aircraft) and one division on the tu-4 (63 aircraft) were considered special (that is, formations of aircraft carrying nuclear weapons) and underwent appropriate training. in addition to bombers, long-range aviation included: five aviation regiments of long-range reconnaissance aircraft on tu-4 aircraft (18 aircraft each with a staff of 22 tu-4s); seven mikoyan-gurevich mig-15bis fighter air regiments , consisting of two fighter air divisions (76 aircraft each with a staff of 116 aircraft) and one separate fighter air regiment (33 mig-15bis with a staff of 36 aircraft); transport air division (35 lisunov li-2). as of january 1, 1958, long-range aviation was equipped with 1,120 tu-16 jet bombers and 778 tu-4 piston-engined bombers. since 1958, the so-called \"engineering\" regiments began to form as part of long-range aviation (the first two based on the 362nd and 454th heavy bomber aviation regiments), which were actually intended for the r-12 and r-14, the first soviet medium-range ballistic missiles. ten such regiments were created by december 1959. from 1959, aviation regiments have been converted directly into missile regiments; in particular, the 37th, 198th, 229th, 250th, 157th heavy bomber aviation regiments. several regiments of tu-16 bombers were transferred to soviet naval aviation (the 12th, 169th, 172nd and 240th heavy bomber aviation regiments). in 1954-1955, as part of the long-range aviation on tu-4k aircraft, the 116th heavy aviation division was formed for the as-1 (ascc \"kennel\") the first domestic projectile aircraft (the term \" cruise missile\" was introduced by order of the minister of defence (soviet union) instead of the term \"projectile aircraft\" in 1960.) in 1957, the 65th air army was renamed the 5th air army and was relocated to blagoveshchensk. as of 1 july 1960 in accordance with soviet air force general staff order 322034, long range aviation was reorganised into the 2nd, 6th, and 8th separate heavy bomber air corps (otbak - otdel\\'niy tyazhely bombandirovochniy aviatsionniy korpus) instead of air armies. this was due to increase in aircraft ordnance capacity, and the option of nuclear weapons ordnance. these three corps were formed from portions of the 43rd, 50th, and 5th air armies da. at the same time, the 43rd and 50th air armies were transferred to the strategic rocket forces, and became the 43rd rocket army and the 50th rocket army. a classified u.s. central intelligence agency report indicated that, at least during the early 1970s, there was no evidence of a quick-reaction posture; in other words, no airborne alert force and no quick-reaction crews on the ground. this stood in stark contrast to the united states air force, which was always at a high state of readiness. furthermore, the 195 bombers belonging to long range aviation were concentrated at only five primary airfields and spent most of their time there. until 1980, the da vs existed as a separate service. in january 1980, the da was disbanded and the heavy bomber units divided between three air armies: the 37th air army of the supreme high command (strategic purpose) (37 va vgk (sn)), with its headquarters in moscow the 46 va vgk (sn) at smolensk the 30th air army (30 va vgk (sn)) with its headquarters at irkutsk, 1980-1994. in april 1987, the tupolev tu-160 entered operational service with the 184th guards heavy bomber regiment located at pryluky air base, ukrainian ssr. the regiment had previously operating tu-16 and tu-22m3 strategic bombers. squadron deployments to long range aviation began the same month, prior to the tu-160\\'s first public appearance in a parade in 1989. in 1988, the three air armies were reunited once again to form the long range aviation command. the strategic plan in the event of a nuclear war with the united states, the soviet union would likely have committed its entire heavy bomber force to attacks against us targets. medium-sized bombers would have been used in a peripheral role. however elements of all of the soviet union\\'s strategic forces would have been available to participate in warsaw pact operations. the cia in 1975 estimated that 530 intermediate-range bombers west of the urals, possibly augmented by soviet navy aircraft, were intended for european strikes in the nato rear area that required large conventional or nuclear payloads. though basing forces in the arctic would have posed more of a threat to north america, the hostile climate, poor logistical network, and weak defence network precluded such a plan. therefore, the soviet union created a network of standby arctic staging bases (\\'bounce airdromes\\'; ) under the control of oga (arctic control group), which would have been activated in wartime. these bases were airfields used for a short stop (\"bounce\") by airplanes for refueling and servicing for the purpose of extending the range of the flight, including long-range military (their staging base). they primarily included olenegorsk, novaya zemlya rogachevo airport, and vorkuta sovetskiy in the northwest; and tiksi airport, anadyr ugolny airport, and mys shmidta in the northeast. high-arctic bases such as nagurskoye and greem-bell may have been available to smaller aircraft, and the staging airfields sredniy ostrov, dresba, chekurovka, and tiksi north were probably never completed. though the tu-95 could operate without the use of staging bases, nearly all other aircraft would have required the facilities in order to reach the united states . bomber crews were trained to be proficient in all basic aspects of strategic operations, including navigation, inflight refueling, air-to-surface missile strike procedures, arctic staging, penetration tactics, and electronic countermeasures. order of battle 1990-91 30th air army order of battle 1990 hq: blagoveshchensk, amur oblast 132nd

long range aviation in russia entered a period of decline, along with the other former components of the soviet armed forces. this culminated when the command was formally disbanded in 1998 as part of the amalgamation of the russian air defence forces and the russian air force. it became the 37th air army of the supreme high command. in 2009 the 37th air army of the supreme command was disbanded as part of the 2008 russian military reforms, reformed once more as the long range aviation command. as of 2020 the long-range aviation forces are being revitalized through both the modernization of aircraft as well as the incorporation of long-range supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles. also in 2020, a new stealth bomber, the tupolev pak da, was reported to be in development. the design of the pak da was reported to have been \"finalized\" in 2021 with initial delivery of the first operational aircraft projected for 2027. since 2015-16, russian long-range aviation includes two frontline divisions: 22nd guards heavy aviation division (formerly 6950th airbase in engels deploying tu-160 blackjack heavy strategic bombers and tu-95msm/ms bear strategic bombers) 326th heavy-bomber division (formerly 6952nd airbase in ukrainka deploying tu-95ms strategic bombers). additional tupolev tu-22m3 backfire bombers were also deployed in 2020 at the belaya air base (with the 200th guards heavy bomber regiment subordinate to the 326th division) and at the shaykovka air base (with the 52nd heavy bomber regiment subordinate to the 22nd division). the 40th mixed aviation regiment at the olenya air base in the northern fleet operational area also flies the backfire. backfire regiments operate in either the land- and/or maritime-strike roles, incorporating long-range stand-off supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles. russian long-range aviation also incorporates a refueling aviation group with ilyushin il-78 tankers. ukraine after the fall of the soviet union, the ukrainian air force was left with three air armies (1,100 combat aircraft), which included 30 tu-16 missile carriers, 33 tu-22kd missile carriers, 30 tu-22r reconnaissance aircraft, 36 tu-22m3s, 23 tu-95mss, 19 tu-160s, 20 ilyushin il-78 aerial refueling aircraft, as well as large stockpiles of missiles: 1,068 kh-55s and 423 kh-22s. in 1992 ukraine also received much of the soviet black sea fleet, including the 2nd guards maritime missile aviation division (hvardiiske, crimea), with three regiments of maritime attack tu-22m2s and an independent maritime reconnaissance aviation regiment (saki-novofedorovka, crimean oblast) of tu-22ps. the 1995/96 edition of the military balance continued to list the remnant of these forces under now-ukrainian naval aviation. in 1994 tu-22m2s, tu-16ks and a large part of the tupolev tu-22ps were put in storage and then dismantled. the reasons for the elimination of ukrainian long-range bombers included: the deep economic crisis in ukraine after the collapse of the ussr pressure from the u.s. state department on ukraine lack of support from production plants and design bureaus which remained in russia reduction in the size of the armed forces resulting in the loss of experienced pilots and supporting personnel life expectancy of some aircraft components and assemblies had expired funding for the elimination of strategic aviation of ukraine was allocated by the u.s. government as part of an agreement \"to provide assistance to ukraine in the elimination of strategic nuclear weapons and to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\", signed on 25 november 1993 between ukraine and the united states. in 2000 in the agreement was extended to 31 december 2006. references \"дальняя авиация. первые 90 лет\", polygon press, 2005, 370 pages.

       " 'the medellín cartel () was a powerful and highly organized colombian drug cartel and terrorist organization originating in the city of medellín, colombia, that was founded and led by pablo escobar. it is often considered to be the first major \"drug cartel\" and was referred to as such; (a cartel) due to the organization\\'s upper echelons and overall power-structure being built on a partnership between multiple colombian traffickers operating alongside escobar. included were jorge luis ochoa vásquez, fabio ochoa vásquez, juan david ochoa vásquez, josé gonzalo rodríguez gacha and carlos lehder. escobar\\'s main partner in the organization however was his cousin gustavo gaviria who handled much of the cartel\\'s shipping arrangements and the more general and detailed logistical aspects of the cocaine trafficking routes and international smuggling networks which were supplying at least 80% of the world\\'s cocaine during its peak. gustavo, also known as león seems to have also had a strong hand in the cartel\\'s unprecedented acts of narcoterrorism, right alongside his cousin pablo and was considered to be second in command of the cartel and therefore one of colombia\\'s most wanted men, with both him and escobar having arrest warrants pending from other nations where their criminal activity had spread to, such as in spain and the u.s. meanwhile, pablo escobar\\'s brother roberto escobar acted as the organization\\'s accountant. the cartel operated from 1976 to 1993 in colombia (antioquia), bolivia, panama, central america, peru, the bahamas, the united states (namely in cities such as los angeles, new york and miami), as well as in canada. although escobar started profitably smuggling contraband by the early 1970s, the true beginnings of what would eventually become the notorious mafia-like organization itself officially turned to trafficking cocaine as their main contraband product by 1976, (largely through the assistance of carlos lehder and george jung) which greatly influenced the infamous sociocultural cocaine boom phenomenon of late 70s and early 80s in the united states. this \"boom\" was noticeably demonstrated by the impact of the violent street crimes which characterized the miami drug war due to the cartel\\'s trafficking operations significantly increasing the drug\\'s overall availability and access through these newly enhanced markets as well as the further complexified and proliferated distribution networks. at the height of its operations, the medellín cartel smuggled multiple tons of cocaine each week into countries around the world and brought in an upwards of us$200 million daily in drug profits, and thus billions per year. additionally, despite being well-known for once dominating the international illicit cocaine trade (along with expanding it) throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, the organization, particularly in its later years, was also noted for its use of violence for political aims (mainly in protest of judicial extradition to the u.s.) as demonstrated by their societally straining and volatile asymmetric war against the colombian state itself, primarily in the form of bombings, kidnappings, indiscriminate murder of law enforcement and political assassinations. many of the victims included non-combatants or random citizens as attempts to negotiate with the government using fear through unambiguous acts of terror. at its height, (during the early 80s) the medellín cartel was recognized as being the largest drug-trafficking syndicate in the world, estimated to have been smuggling three times as much cocaine as their main competitor, the cali cartel, an international drug-trafficking organization based in the valle del cauca department of colombia. however, some experts and u.s. government officials have claimed the opposite, or said that most data compiled during this period was potentially skewed since most of the national security-based focus was mostly centered on the medellín organization specifically due its more ostentatious acts of violence and \"vindictive\" nature. relations between the medellín and cali trafficking organizations traditionally, pablo and the medellín cartel originally had a strategic alliance and specific smuggling arrangement with the cali cartel \"godfathers\" gilberto rodríguez orejuela and miguel rodríguez orejuela early on. this arrangement resulted in medellín controlling the cocaine trade in los angeles, cali controlling new york city, while both of them agreed to share miami and houston. eventually however, a personal dispute between escobar and one of the cali cartel leaders named pacho herrera surfaced over a disagreement on territory in one or more of these distribution hubs. although the two organizations had scrimmages beforehand; by 1988 (supposedly after the monaco apartment bombing) the medellín and cali organizations became perpetual enemies, a feud which continued until medellín\\'s eventual demise in 1993. a demise which was largely due to the rise of the anti-escobar \"vigilante\" group known as los pepes, which was officially formed in january of 1993. \"los pepes\" was a diminutive form of the phrase \"perseguidos por pablo escobar\" (meaning: \"[those] persecuted by pablo escobar\"). the group was largely financed by the cali cartel and led by brothers carlos and fidel castaño whom were right-wing paramilitary leading commanders that were actually once part of the medellín cartel. los pepe\\'s tactics, which were stylized to reflect escobar\\'s own violent methods now turned against him, and which proved ultimately instrumental to the progressive defeat of the medellín cartel reign, was further accentuated by pablo\\'s accumulation of enemies within his own organization (helping to characterize the formation of los pepes), as well as pablo\\'s ongoing and relentless war against the colombian government and american law-enforcement agencies; a combination of factors which cornered escobar during the last year of his life, along with his quickly diminishing sphere of power as the now final and last-standing leader of his once dominant cartel. during the initial days of their mutual alliance however, before these intense conflicts; the cali and medellín groups each showcased differing philosophies over how to \"ameliorate\" their situations with the authorities. while the more \\'businesslike\\' orejuela brothers of cali wanted to solve such legal issues through corruption, escobar instead sought to do so mostly through violence and intimidation. particularly when his (often minimal) attempts to bribe officials were not immediately accepted. notably, escobar and the medellín crew also garnered a unique reputation, even in their earlier days for murdering not only those who crossed them, but oftentimes their immediate family members or other relatives as well, unless otherwise stipulated such as when pablo\\'s enemies \"turned themselves in\" instead of fleeing the region or pleading for protection from the authorities (many of whom were already compromised). this method of \"webbed\" violence resulting from one person\\'s mistakes against escobar was reportedly explained directly to american smuggler george jung when he first met pablo in 1978 moments after witnessing a man get shot in the chest after he \"voluntarily\" gave himself up to escobar upon the knowledge that the man\\'s entire family would be killed if he did not. while pablo escobar seemingly viewed fear through violence and extortion (threats) as an effective motivator and more straightforward measure, cali leader gilberto in particular thought violence should only be used as a last resort, considering it to be generally bad for business due to the practical understanding that; \"dead people do not pay what they owe\". the cali cartel leaders even required their employees to fill out \"application forms\"; elucidating their personal information, not necessarily for the sake of threats but rather for the purpose of thorough background checks and security. this included not just names and addresses of cali cartel hopefuls, but financial assets and personal possessions such as automobiles. the orejuela brothers wanted to be seen as \"the kennedys of colombia\" while escobar similarly dreamed of one day becoming president of the nation. when this failed however due to scandals over his criminal reputation, escobar thereafter began a brutal; nearly decade-long terroristic campaign against the government from april of 1984 starting with the assassination of rodrigo lara bonilla (colombia\\'s minister of justice who favored extradition), to april of 1993 with the massive 440 pound bomb detonation in bogotá\\'s busy center 93 shopping mall on the city\\'s popular 15th avenue neighborhood. history background & early 1970s 1960s cocaine trade in latin america in the 1960s, colombia was not yet viewed or stereotyped as being a conventional geophysical, narcotrafficking corridor for the world\\'s cocaine trade like it seems to have been for marijuana trafficking at this time. by the late 1960s, colombia\\'s marijuana trade resulted from booming production in the sierra nevada de santa marta and the urabá peninsula where it was then smuggled within hidden northbound shipments of bananas. reportedly when it came to the international cocaine trade during the 60s; argentina, brazil and chile were the countries with the biggest hand in the international transferring of cocaine. rio de janeiro (brazil), buenos aires (argentina) and valparaiso (chile) acted as some of the most common starting points for the 1960s maritime trafficking routes while havana, cuba was commonly used as an intermediary transshipment point north. then it would go to locations like panama city in florida or barcelona in spain which both regularly functioned as final points of destination for the international transporting of cocaine or other related contraband from south america. cartagena, in colombia and miami, florida still seemed to play a modest role however. however, marijuana was still said to dominate the loads of shipments which traveled through these routes at the time. therefore, cocaine\\'s prevalence by then still went largely under the radar due to how in the united states, even though cocaine use was steadily rising by the 1960s, it was still only marginally - moderately more popular when compared to its relative scope of prevalence during the 1950s when the use of cocaine was considered to be at an all-time low and was essentially considered by many to mostly be \"a problem of the past\". colombian smugglers & chileans (1972-1976) in contrast to his law-abiding parents, escobar began a life of crime early on; stealing tombstones from cemeteries, sanding down the headstones to make them appear unused, reselling them, stealing cars, kidnapping people for ransom; including a wealthy businessman at one point before eventually settling into the criminal occupation known as contraband smuggling which characterized a large swath and subcultural domain of colombia\\'s criminal underworld at this time. this is presumably around when his gang-like organizational abilities and his criminal racketeering predilections seems to have come together in what was now the early 1970s in medellín, colombia. escobar would go on to take advantage of colombia\\'s fertile and expanding marijuana trade as well as the apparent smuggling and illegal trade of cigarettes. there are several claims that he was allegedly a noteworthy figure in the region\\'s supposed \"marlboro wars\"; a seemingly violent set of scrimmages or conflicts over the control of colombia\\'s illicit cigarette smuggling market. this implying that he was priming his sensibilities in street crime and violent black market schemes in what would come out in a much more organized and violent fashion not far down the line. in 1973, there was a military coup in chile which led to a strong crackdown on chilean drug traffickers. this caused some drug traffickers to either flee the country and/or immediately start to use different trafficking routes. this frequently resulted in chilean traffickers setting their eyes on colombia to use as a trade route further north. around the same time, the prevalence and social acceptance of contraband in colombia was at an all-time high. late 1970searly 1980s background in the mid to late 1970s, specifically around 1975 and 1976; the illegal cocaine trade started to become a growing and significant problem for american law enforcement as the drug\\'s prevalence began to quickly takeoff in unanticipated ways. initially, its first phase of substantial growth in popularity started out among the affluent, particularly among those in the entertainment industry in hollywood, california before quickly spreading to other major hotspots such as miami. because of cocaine\\'s socially prestigious reputation as a cultural symbol of high-status, especially as it related to wealth and glamor among americans during the late 1970s (mainly due to its high cost); the colombian criminals who were already accomplished smugglers of various goods and commercialized black market trade networks began to see cocaine as an irresistibly lucrative item for smuggling. a product like cocaine which \"packs tighter\" than other types of drugs or contraband indicated a greater, more eased potential for logistical transportability, with less of a chance for interdiction or complications during the product\\'s long journey across borders and to various regional markets around the globe. this further maximized the profit potential since its volume and weight relative to its final monetary value would now be exponentially greater than it would have been from trafficking the same or similar weight and volume of a less valuable a product like marijuana. also, unlike marijuana, which can already be produced within close proximity to the desirable north american drug markets; cocaine production was basically exclusive to south america at this time and therefore easier for south american criminal groups to control and monopolize on. at this time during the 1970s, many of the most well-established, entrepreneurial, and capable contraband smugglers or trafficking groups were composed of colombian nationals. but even among them, the soon-to-be-massively wealthy drug lord pablo escobar stood out from the rest. escobar soon became characterized by his strategy of providing protection and mutually beneficial collaboration to other smugglers who partnered with him and helped further distribute the organization\\'s cocaine into markets of high demand such as new york city and eventually miami. thus soon after forming a larger and more formidable criminal web of suppliers and combined trade networks that now further empowered escobar and his cousin\\'s operations via this newly formed collaborative criminal effort and structural design made up of different traffickers now working together (hence the term cartel), this imparted unparalleled degrees of strength and wealth to the organization causing it to eventually, at its height move 2,500 - 3,500 kilos per day. since the organizational-criminal power structure already present to a degree within escobar and gustavo\\'s earlier proto-trafficking organization or smuggling network ascended itself as a result of cocaine\\'s unusually high profit margins after even just brief exposure to the cocaine business and north american market distribution, the level of power and influence which naturally followed these unprecedented levels of wealth, the then \"cartel-style\" model for pablo and gustavo\\'s criminal organization began to reach fruition between 1976 and 1979 roughly, where it now also incorporated the contraband smuggling networks of the ochoas (jorge luis ochoa vásquez, fabio ochoa vásquez and juan david ochoa vásquez), as well as the trafficking enterprise and muscle (armed men) working under josé gonzalo rodríguez gacha; nicknamed \"the mexican\", and the eccentric german colombian figure carlos lehder who initially partnered up with the infamous american smuggler george jung or \"boston george\" who he was bunkmates with in prison at the federal correctional institution, danbury where jung was incarcerated at the same time as lehder on charges of marijuana trafficking. prior to this, escobar\\'s initial smuggling ring and control over small gangs of hired gunmen on his payroll was merely just a precursor to the final and full-fledged massive criminal organization (economic cartel) itself. once these other successful smugglers already acquainted with escobar stepped in to combine their trafficking power and capabilities with escobar\\'s after seeing the level of wealth amassed from cocaine when marketed in the north american transportation hubs of and ever-growing demand; this is when the label \"cartel\" came into play, although the organization\\'s members did not originally refer to themselves as such. the term cartel in reference to the economical-organizational nature of these now commonplace latin american drug trafficking groups in particular, seems to have been a label first coined by the us state department or intelligence community in order to distinguish these higher-level crime mobs from traditional moderate-sized gangs. eventually with the drug cartel label becoming a household name where it likely later on then became a label embraced by the criminal group itself during its later years. this kind of economic bolstering resulting from collaborations between the power structures of once separate groups essentially gave way to a type of positive feedback loop, where a further gain in drug profits after their initial expansion in size inevitably led to an even greater consolidation of power and growth which then subsequently led to another cycle of increased profiting and so on and so forth. carlos lehder and george jung (1976-1978) jung described the danbury prison facility located in connecticut as a \"medium-low security prison\" that was \"full of mob guys\". he goes on to point out the \"irony\" (likely due to his marijuana charges) of him being assigned colombian carlos lehder as a bunkmate who was serving a sentence for stealing cars and shipping them to south america. they casually discussed their charges, jung mentioning he was caught flying marijuana out of mexico; lehder responded by asking him if he \"knew anything about cocaine\". he did not at the time, but became immediately entranced when lehder went on to say; \"you know it costs $60,000 a kilo\". a proclamation that functioned as a compelling sales pitch for jung; they both waited until getting out before attempting to get involved in the cocaine business. while incarcerated together, jung benefited lehder by giving him valuable input and tips on how to smuggle drugs effectively. jung was knowledgeable in this area due to his past experience flying shipments of marijuana across international borders—from mexico into the us, and within the us, from california to new england. lehder, however, would also be of benefit to jung, once they were both released from prison, by introducing him to colombia\\'s most powerful drug smuggler: pablo escobar. this would prove useful to jung in the future, when later he and lehder had a falling out and were no longer in business together. around 1976, both men were out of prison (jung being released slightly after lehder). lehder\\'s behavior became increasingly erratic, supposedly \"crazed\" and \"megalomaniacal\" in the last two or three years of the 1970s, spiraling even further during the early 1980s. by decade\\'s end (around 1978), lehder had betrayed jung. lehder did this by trying to push jung out of the business and began setting up his own major cocaine transshipment operation for escobar and the medellín organization on an island in the bahamas called norman\\'s cay. here, lehder would take up an unconventional, hedonistic, drug-fueled lifestyle after getting the island\\'s residents to leave, either by force or by bribery. jung from that point on just attempted to steer clear of lehder, so he simply went back to colombia to meet with escobar directly, in order to establish a new, but now more modestly-sized, trafficking endeavor. this was to continue to operate under escobar\\'s network, since the two still had a good relationship, and escobar could directly utilize lehder as a reliable connection for acquiring sizable amounts of south american powdered cocaine. both jung and lehder made millions of dollars, not just for themselves, but for the cartel too, with their highly successful cocaine-distribution operation, that arguably may have been a factor in triggering america\\'s cultural \"cocaine era\"; the take-off of this cultural phenomenon noticeably coincided with the beginning of jung and lehder\\'s involvement in cocaine distribution. despite their incredibly profitable smuggling operation, it only lasted from roughly 1976 to 1978. in this short period, however, they were able to achieve a historically unprecedented drug-trafficking operation that proved invaluable to escobar\\'s and the medellín cartel\\'s overall initial rise to being the preeminent cocaine enterprise. both jung and lehder were in the unique position of not only having been around during the very earliest days of the medellín trafficking conglomerate which later birthed the cartel, but were also both in many ways directly responsible for the accelerated growth during its beginnings. although escobar and the others were highly capable and ingenious smugglers, they technically still did not have a major market in the united states or a major transportation system for their product. it was jung and lehder who effectively provided this. from independent smuggling ring to collaborative cartel (1976-1979) pablo escobar and his cousin gustavo\\'s mid-70s newly transformed trafficking operation aimed at moving cocaine powder into america after first fully ascertaining the indispensable distribution network capabilities and other logistical elements both carlos lehder and george jung could facilitate for the sale of their product in the now major emerging markets was about to undergo another type of expansion. after carrying out their new cocaine operations with this augmented distribution system, this soon led the two cousins (pablo and gustavo) to amass a staggering amount of wealth in such a short timeframe (primarily due to jung and lehder), that their other fellow colombian criminal acquaintances who were already noteworthy regional figures in the smuggling world, such as josé rodriguez gacha and the ochoas who were not yet part of the organization but began to more seriously consider getting involved with the two cousins and the cocaine business eventually came into the fold. at this point, pablo and gustavo converged the increasing power and wealth of their single \"independent\" smuggling-ring towards a conglomerate made up of the multiple aforementioned smuggling rings coupled together in a collaborative fashion so as to give the overall organization a stronger backbone and structural apparatus by allowing gacha and the ochoas to pair up and synergize the relative power-spheres of their own trafficking networks with escobar\\'s, so as to maximize and concentrate their power instead of keeping it divided. after seeing the results of pablo and gustavo\\'s impressive rates of profit and success (which now surpassed the ochoas), they all soon began to prioritize the smuggling of cocaine over virtually all other forms of \\'goods\\' and contraband, such as the items of commerce that had already served to profit them in years past. 1980s cocaine boom this lucrative and newfound, expansive network of traffickers began to creatively utilize many novel methods of getting their cocaine product into the u.s. at that point; implementing increased ingenuity and novel strategies into the smuggling logistics. this ranged from cocaine-stuffed hollow pellets, multilayered condoms, or balloons which are then swallowed by mules to make it through customs or international borders (especially in commercial flight transportation) without detection, to hefty amounts loaded onto cessnas; these now being recognized as a favorite method for smugglers throughout the years because of their ability to fly slowly which permit more accurate deliveries to drop zones. some smuggling strategies also purportedly included diverting law-enforcement\\'s attention away from one smuggled load of cocaine in order to smuggle in an even larger amount when authorities\\' attention and related interdiction resources were distracted or compromised. these rapid and clever innovations in illegal drug trafficking techniques by increasingly and well-funded organized criminal groups; such as escobar and his medellín associates proved to be too much for american law enforcement to effectively catch up with or curtail, especially with the price of cocaine dropping by 1980 and becoming yet even more popular and now among a much wider demographic instead of mostly just the affluent as it was in the late 70s. this would inevitably result in the manifestation of widespread cocaine use and cultural normalization, simultaneous crime waves in almost all major us cities, as well as small \"drug wars\" within the evermore relevant transshipment point areas or cities like miami (see: miami drug war) as well as in the ghettos of los angeles (see: freeway ricky ross). therefore, by the turn of the decade it was no longer just a drug of the sybaritic and wealthy despite still being a cultural status symbol of class and wealth in the early 80s. the united states\\' \"cocaine boom\" era enriched the colombian smugglers and catapulted them into massive levels of profit and wealth that now was in the billions of dollars, essentially all in the form of cash. during the cartel\\'s peak, escobar oversaw the import of large shipments of coca paste from andean nations such as peru and bolivia into colombia, where it was then processed into powdered cocaine in jungle labs such as in the case of tranquilandia, before being flown into the united states in amounts of up to 15 tons per day at some points. by 1982, cocaine surpassed coffee as the chief colombian export (see: coffee production in colombia). around this time in the early 1980s, kidnappings made by guerrilla groups led the state to collaborate with criminal groups like those formed by escobar and the ochoas. the abduction of carlos lehder as well as the 1981 kidnapping of the sister of the ochoas; martha ochoa which led to the creation of cartel-funded private armies that were created to fight off guerrillas who were trying to either redistribute their lands to local peasants, kidnap them, or extort the gramaje money that the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia or farc) attempted to steal. \"death to kidnappers\" (1981) at the end of 1981 and the beginning of 1982, members of the medellín cartel, cali cartel, the colombian military, the u.s.-based corporation texas petroleum, the colombian legislature, small industrialists, and wealthy cattle ranchers came together in a series of meetings in puerto boyacá and formed a paramilitary organization known as muerte a secuestradores (\"death to kidnappers\", mas) to defend their economic interests, and to provide protection for local elites from kidnappings and extortion. by 1983, colombian internal affairs had registered 240 political killings by mas death squads, mostly community leaders, elected officials, and farmers. the following year, the asociación campesina de ganaderos y agricultores del magdalena medio (\"association of middle magdalena ranchers and farmers\", acdegam) was created to handle both the logistics and the public relations of the organization, and to provide a legal front for various paramilitary groups. acdegam worked to promote anti-labor policies, and threatened anyone involved with organizing for labor or peasants\\' rights. the threats were backed up by the mas, which would attack or assassinate anyone who was suspected of being a \"subversive\". acdegam also built schools whose stated purpose was the creation of a \"patriotic and anti-communist\" educational environment, and built roads, bridges, and health clinics. paramilitary recruiting, weapons storage, communications, propaganda, and medical services were all run out of acdegam headquarters. by the mid-1980s, acdegam and mas had undergone significant growth. in 1985, pablo escobar began funneling large amounts of cash into the organization to pay for equipment, training, and weaponry. money for social projects was cut off and redirected towards strengthening the mas. modern battle rifles, such as the akm, fn fal, galil, and hk g3, were purchased from the military, indumil, and drug-funded private sales. the organization had computers and ran a communications center that worked in coordination with the state telecommunications office. they had 30 pilots, and an assortment of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. british, israeli, and u.s. military instructors were hired to teach at paramilitary training centers. middlelate 1980s following this time in the mid-80s, escobar\\'s hold on medellín further increased when he founded a criminal debt collection service known as the \"oficina de envigado\" (the office), which was considered their first \"oficina de cobro\" (collections service). this was an actual physical office located in the town hall of envigado, a small municipality next to medellín where escobar grew up. escobar used the municipal office to collect debts owed to him by other drug traffickers and set the \"sicarios\" or hired killers on those who refused. escobar was known to flaunt his wealth and went on to make forbes\\' billionaires list for seven years straight, between 1987 and 1993. his luxurious multimillion-dollar \"hacienda nápoles\" estate had its own zoo, and he reportedly ate from solid gold dinner sets. escobar was known for investing profits from the drug trade in luxury goods, property, and works of art. he is also reported to have stashed his cash in \"hidden coves\", allegedly burying it on his farms and under floors in many of his houses. \"los extraditables\" (1984) early 1990s pablo escobar\\'s death (december, 1993) after a long, drawn-out manhunt that lasted many months; on the 2nd of december, 1993 escobar was finally found with only one bodyguard left by his side; limón (alvaro de jesús agudelo) who was also his longtime chauffeur (driver). they were found hiding out in a house in a middle-class residential area of his hometown of medellín (carrera 79b no. 45d - 94, los olivos neighborhood) by colombian special forces supposedly using tracking technology provided by the united states. this was a direct consequence of escobar the day before; on his 44th birthday (wednesday) making a call from the hideout location to his family who were being protected by the government in a luxury hotel in the nation\\'s capital of bogota. this was also just after the family had returned from an unsuccessful attempt to travel by plane and take refuge in germany. the authorities, going off the traceable data from the hotel which received escobar\\'s call began to utilize an electronic tracking system in order to pinpoint the geographical positioning that the call had originated from. at this time, escobar who now had a long beard according to witnesses had apparently been hiding out there for almost six weeks. first after some initial troubleshooting, both the drug lord and limón were eventually located the next day. police tried to arrest escobar upon arrival, but the situation quickly escalated to an exchange of gunfire. by the time pablo and limón escaped the inside of the building and tried to outrun the authorities on a tiled terracotta rooftop, limón was soon shot and killed. moments later escobar himself was then shot and killed as he continued to try and make his way from the pursuing officers whilst still running across the top of the roof to escape. he was hit by bullets in the torso and feet, and a bullet which struck him in the ear, killing him. this has sparked debate however about whether he killed himself or whether he was actually shot dead by the colombian authorities, with his son sebastián marroquín (formerly named; juan pablo escobar) still believing to this day that he shot himself due to the positioning of the bullet\\'s entry wound behind his ear where he says his father would\\'ve apparently aimed for if he was going to attempt to kill himself. escobar\\'s primary objective in an end scenario such as this was simply to not allow himself to be captured alive and suffer for the rest of his life in the u.s. prison system via extradition or to be captured and tortured like he did to so many others. escobar\\'s legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes and terrorism, he was still seen as a \"robin hood-like\" figure for many in colombia, as he provided many amenities such as the funding of infrastructure and residencies for the poor, especially in barrios throughout the areas surrounding medellín. his death was mourned and his funeral attended by over 25,000 people. additionally, his private estate, hacienda nápoles was thereafter eventually transformed into a theme park. his life as a major cocaine trafficker and incredibly wealthy criminal (bandido) has been dramatized widely in film and has served as inspiration for pop cultural references and the retelling of his gripping story as a prominent drug lord in both television, books and music. political relations during the later years of the cold war, the number of left-wing guerrillas spread in latin america skyrocketed. the conflicts between them and the right-wing paramilitaries groups and dictatorships, mostly backed by cia, made the cartel\\'s search for new allies while it was forced to be involved in corruption outside colombia for political protection. relations with the colombian government once u.s. authorities were made aware of \"questionable activities\", the group was put under federal drug task force surveillance. evidence was gathered, compiled, and presented to a grand jury, resulting in indictments, arrests, and prison sentences for those convicted in the united states. however, very few colombian cartel leaders were actually taken into custody as a result of these operations. mostly, non-colombians conspiring with the cartel were the \"fruits\" of these indictments in the united states. most colombians targeted, as well as those named in such indictments, lived and stayed in colombia, or fled before indictments were unsealed. however, by 1993 most, if not all, cartel fugitives had been either imprisoned, or located and shot dead, by the colombian national police trained and assisted by specialized military units and the cia. the last of escobar\\'s lieutenants to be assassinated was juan diego arcila henao, who had been released from a colombian prison in 2002 and hidden in venezuela to avoid the vengeance of \"los pepes\". however he was shot and killed in his jeep cherokee as he exited the parking area of his home in cumaná, venezuela, in april 2007. while it is broadly believed that los pepes have been instrumental in the assassination of the cartel\\'s members over the last 21 years, it is still in dispute whether the mantle is just a screen designed to deflect political repercussions from both the colombian and united states governments\\' involvement in these assassinations. relations with the cia the kerry committee report had reached the conclusion that the cia provided the political protection for the contras to smuggle cocaine into the us, as the money from these operations was employed in the fight against the sandinista government. also the same report made public that juan matta-ballesteros, the link between the medellin cartel and the guadalajara one and responsible for most of cocaine logistics from colombia to mexico, was collaborating with the contras, sending weapons, general supplies and the cocaine itself - this leads to the conclusion that the cocaine supplied to the contras was medellin cartel\\'s product. things began changing after the report was published as the cia was forced to save face in the scandal. the agency blamed the cocaine smuggling to the colombian guerrillas and explored the links between the medellin cartel and the left-wing organizations, making the right-wing paramilitaries in colombia turn against the medellin cartel, helping forming the los pepes death squad. this would also allow the cia to participate more directly in the colombian armed conflict. another action from the cia to clean its image was the removal of support for manuel noriega, who was prosecuted for conspiracy with drug smuggling activities between 1989 and 1990. the cia, once one of noriega\\'s allies, was one of the minds back the operation just cause, which effectively ended noriega\\'s term and led to his arrest. the end of the panamian connection was one of the hardest hits on the cartel operations, speeding up its decline. relations with nicaraguan government the carlos lehder\\'s norman\\'s cay strategy was shut down in 1982 after the bahamian government started chasing the drug traffic. hence, central america was the path chosen by the cartel to reach the us. in 1985, the dea, knowing about barry seal ties with both the medellin cartel, made the pilot take pictures of the cartel\\'s landing stripes in nicaragua. the dea prior investigation appointed that the cartel had the protection from the fsln, the sandinist party, to use nicaragua as a \"warehouse\" for matta-ballesteros\\' logistic operation for either medellin and guadalajara cartels. knowing seal\\'s activity as a dea informant, the cartel put a contract on him, having him murdered in february 1986. in march 16 the same year, during a tv national address, the president of the united states ronald reagan used surveillance pictures taken on seal\\'s undercover mission that showed escobar, gacha, the nicaraguan government official federico vaughan and several other men loading a plane with cocaine. relations with panamanian government after manuel noriega arrest, the dea and fbi got several tips linking the former dictator to the medellin cartel. the nicaraguan and colombian conflicts in remote areas could make both countries unsafe to operate, and the cartel was searching for new places to use as a stopover. manuel noriega, in exchange of bribes and share on profits, agreed using panama as another stopover for the cartel logistics. also, the links between him and the cartel ensured that panama could be a hideout for the group leadership and that the government would ignore their money laundering operations in the country. the cia turned a blind eye to the link between medellin cartel and noriega, as he had an aggressive anticommunist policy. however, the agency stopped supporting noriega after his ties with the cartel came to public. relations with cuban government during the 1980 decade, the decrease and later end of soviet union subsidies almost wiped out the cuban economy. during manuel noriega judgement, carlos lehder, the cartel member responsible for ensuring that the cocaine would reach florida, testified that, as the drug smuggling to the usa was doing billions of dollars, cuban intelligence helped manage nicaraguan operations and the island\\'s government agreed to using cuba as one of the stopovers for the cartel. this was made with knowledge of the castro brothers, having the younger, raúl castro, met with lehder. fear of extradition perhaps the greatest threat posed to the medellín cartel and the other traffickers was the implementation of an extradition treaty between the united states and colombia. it allowed colombia to extradite to the us any colombian suspected of drug trafficking and to be tried there for their crimes. this was a major problem for the cartel, since the drug traffickers had little access to their local power and influence in the us, and a trial there would most likely lead to imprisonment. among the staunch supporters of the extradition treaty were colombian justice minister rodrigo lara (who was pushing for more action against the drug cartels), police officer jaime ramírez, and numerous colombian supreme court judges. however, the cartel applied a \"bend or break\" strategy towards several of these supporters, using bribery, extortion, or violence. nevertheless, when police efforts began to cause major losses, some of the major drug lords themselves were temporarily pushed out of colombia, forcing them into hiding from which they ordered cartel members to take out key supporters of the extradition treaty. the cartel issued death threats to the supreme court judges, asking them to denounce the extradition treaty. the warnings were ignored. this led escobar and the group he called los extraditables (\"the extraditables\") to start a violent campaign to pressure the colombian government by committing a series of kidnappings, murders, and narco-terrorist actions. alleged relation with the m-19 in november 1985, 35 heavily armed members of the m-19 guerrilla group stormed the colombian supreme court in bogotá, leading to the palace of justice siege. some claimed at the time that the cartel\\'s influence was behind the m-19\\'s raid, because of its interest in intimidating the supreme court. others state that the alleged cartel-guerrilla relationship was unlikely to occur at the time because the two organizations had been having several standoffs and confrontations, like the kidnappings by m-19 of drug lord carlos lehder and of marta nieves ochoa, the sister of juan david ochoa. these kidnappings led to the creation of the mas/muerte a secuestradores (\"death to kidnappers\") paramilitary group by pablo escobar. former guerrilla members have also denied that the cartel had any part in this event. the issue continues to be debated inside colombia. assassinations as a means of intimidation, the cartel conducted thousands of assassinations throughout the country. escobar and his associates made it clear that whoever stood against them would risk being killed along with their families. some estimates put the total around 3,500 killed during the height of the cartel\\'s activities, including over 500 police officers in medellín, but the entire list is impossible to assemble, due to the limitation of the judiciary power in colombia. the following is a brief list of the most notorious assassinations conducted by the cartel: luis vasco and gilberto hernandez, two das agents who had arrested pablo escobar in 1976. among the earliest assassinations of authority figures by the cartel. rodrigo lara, minister of justice, killed on a bogotá highway on april 30, 1984, when two gunmen riding a motorcycle approached his vehicle in traffic and opened fire. tulio manuel castro gil, superior judge which investigating escobar for the assassination of two das agents which in 1977 arrested escobar and his cousin gustavo gaviria, killed by motorcycle gunmen in july 1985, shortly after indicting escobar. hernando baquero borda, supreme court justice; rapporteur and defender of the extradition treaty with the united states, killed by gunmen in bogotá on july 31, 1986. jaime ramírez gómez, police colonel and head of the anti-narcotics unit of the national police of colombia. killed near fontibon on his way to bogota on november 17, 1986, when assassins in a green renault 18 beside his red mitsubishi montero and opened fire. ramírez was killed instantly; his wife and two sons were unharmed guillermo cano isaza, director of el espectador who revealed publicly escobar\\'s criminal past, killed on december 17, 1986, in bogotá by gunmen riding a motorcycle. jaime pardo leal, presidential candidate and head of the patriotic union party, killed by a gunman in october 1987. carlos mauro hoyos, attorney general, kidnapped then killed by gunmen in medellín in january 1988. antonio roldan betancur, governor of antioquia, killed by a car bomb in july 1989. waldemar franklin quintero, commander of the antioquia police, killed by gunmen in medellín in august 1989. luis carlos galán, presidential candidate, killed by gunmen during a rally in soacha in august 1989. the assassination was carried out on the same day the commander of the antioquia police was gunned down by the cartel. carlos ernesto valencia, superior judge, killed by gunmen shortly after indicting escobar on the death of guillermo cano, in august 1989. jorge enrique pulido, journalist, director of jorge enrique pulido tv, killed by gunmen in bogotá in november 1989. diana turbay, journalist, chief editor of the hoy por hoy magazine and former president julio césar turbay ayala\\'s daughter, killed by colombian military during a rescue attempt in january 1991. actually, the bullet found in her body came from a police helicopter. enrique low murtra, minister of justice, killed by gunmen in downtown bogotá in may 1991. myriam rocio velez, superior judge, killed by gunmen shortly before she was to sentence escobar on the assassination of galán, in september 1992. miguel maza márquez was targeted in the das building bombing, resulting in the death of 52 civilians caught in the blast. miguel escaped unharmed. in 1993, shortly before escobar\\'s death, the cartel lieutenants were also targeted by the vigilante group los pepes (or pepes, people persecuted by pablo escobar). with the assassination of juan diego arcila henao in 2007, most if not all of escobar\\'s lieutenants who were not in prison had been killed by the colombian national police search bloc (trained and assisted by u.s. delta force and cia operatives), or by the los pepes vigilantes. dea agents considered that their four-pronged \"kingpin strategy\", specifically targeting senior cartel figures, was a major contributing factor to the collapse of the organization. legacy la oficina de envigado is believed to be a partial successor to the medellín organization. it was founded by don berna as an enforcement wing for the medellín cartel. when don berna fell out with escobar, la oficina caused escobar\\'s rivals to oust escobar. the organization then inherited the medellín turf and its criminal connections in the us, mexico, and the uk, and began to affiliate with the paramilitary united self-defense forces of colombia, organizing drug trafficking operations on their behalf. in popular culture the cartel has been both featured and referenced in numerous works of popular culture. kings of cocaine:

       " 'the point-to-point protocol over ethernet (pppoe) is a network protocol for encapsulating point-to-point protocol (ppp) frames inside ethernet frames. it appeared in 1999, in the context of the boom of dsl as the solution for tunneling packets over the dsl connection to the isp\\'s ip network, and from there to the rest of the internet. a 2005 networking book noted that \"most dsl providers use pppoe, which provides authentication, encryption, and compression.\" typical use of pppoe involves leveraging the ppp facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password, predominately via the pap protocol and less often via chap. around 2000, pppoe was also starting to become a replacement method for talking to a modem connected to a computer or router over an ethernet lan displacing the older method, which had been usb. this use-case, connecting routers to modems over ethernet is still extremely common today. on the customer-premises equipment, pppoe may be implemented either in a unified residential gateway device that handles both dsl modem and ip routing functions or in the case of a simple dsl modem (without routing support), pppoe may be handled behind it on a separate ethernet-only router or even directly on a user\\'s computer. (support for pppoe is present in most operating systems, ranging from windows xp, linux to mac os x.) more recently, some gpon-based (instead of dsl-based) residential gateways also use pppoe, although the status of pppoe in the gpon standards is marginal. pppoe was developed by uunet, redback networks (now ericsson) and routerware (now wind river systems) and is available as an informational rfc 2516. in the world of dsl, pppoe was commonly understood to be running on top of atm (or dsl) as the underlying transport, although no such limitation exists in the pppoe protocol itself. other usage scenarios are sometimes distinguished by tacking as a suffix another underlying transport. for example, pppoeoe, when the transport is ethernet itself, as in the case of metro ethernet networks. (in this notation, the original use of pppoe would be labeled pppoeoa, although it should not be confused with pppoa, which is a different encapsulation protocol.) pppoe has been described in some books as a \"layer 2.5\" protocol, in some rudimentary sense similar to mpls because it can be used to distinguish different ip flows sharing an ethernet infrastructure, although the lack of pppoe switches making routing decisions based on pppoe headers limits applicability in that respect. original rationale in late 1998, the dsl service model had yet to reach the large scale that would bring prices down to household levels. adsl technology had been proposed a decade earlier. potential equipment vendors and carriers alike recognized that broadband such as cable modem or dsl would eventually replace dialup service, but the hardware (both customer premises and lec) faced a significant low-quantity cost barrier. initial estimates for low-quantity deployment of dsl showed costs in the $300-$500 range for a dsl modem and $300/month access fee from the telco, which was well beyond what a home user would pay. thus the initial focus was on small and home business customers for whom a ~1.5 megabit t1 line (at the time $800-$1500 per month) was not economical, but who needed more than dialup or isdn could deliver. if enough of these customers paved the way, quantities would drive the prices down to where the home-use dialup user might be interested. different usage profile the problem was that small business customers had a different usage profile than a home-use dialup user, including: connecting an entire lan to the internet; providing services on a local lan accessible from the far side of the connection; simultaneous access to multiple external data sources, such as a company vpn and a general purpose isp; continuous usage throughout the workday, or even around the clock. these requirements didn\\'t lend themselves to the connection establishment lag of a dial-up process nor its one-computer-to-one-isp model, nor even the many-to-one that nat plus dial-up provided. a new model was required. pppoe is used mainly either: with pppoe-speaking internet dsl services where a pppoe-speaking modem-router (residential gateway) connects to the dsl service. here both isp and modem-router need to speak pppoe. (note that in this case, the pppoe-over-dsl side of things is occasionally referred to as pppoeoa, for ‘pppoe over atm\\'.) or when a pppoe-speaking dsl modem is connected to a pppoe-speaking ethernet-only router using an ethernet cable. time to market: simpler is better one problem with creating a completely new protocol to fill these needs was time. the equipment was available immediately, as was the service, and a whole new protocol stack (microsoft at the time was advocating fiber-based atm-cells-to-the-desktop, and l2tp was brewing as well, but was not near completion) would take so long to implement that the window of opportunity might slip by. several decisions were made to simplify implementation and standardization in an effort to deliver a complete solution quickly. reuse existing software stacks pppoe hoped to merge the widespread ethernet infrastructure with the ubiquitous ppp, allowing vendors to reuse their existing software and deliver products in the very near term. essentially all operating systems at the time had a ppp stack, and the design of pppoe allowed for a simple shim at the line-encoding stage to convert from ppp to pppoe. simplify hardware requirements competing wan technologies (t1, isdn) required a router on the customer premises. pppoe used a different ethernet frame type, which allowed the dsl hardware to function as simply a bridge, passing some frames to the wan and ignoring the others. implementation of such a bridge is multiple orders of magnitude simpler than a router. informational rfc rfc 2516 was initially released as an informational (rather than standards-track) rfc for the same reason: the adoption period for a standards-track rfc was prohibitively long. success pppoe was initially designed to provide a small lan with individual independent connections to the internet at large, but also such that the protocol itself would be lightweight enough that it wouldn\\'t impinge on the hoped-for home usage market when it finally arrived. while success on the second matter may be debated (some complain that 8 bytes per packet is too much) pppoe clearly succeeded in bringing sufficient volume to drive the price for service down to what a home user would pay. modern-day use-cases around 2000, the pppoe protocol was used either (i) to connect a dsl modem to a computer or router, displacing the earlier method of using usb, or (ii) the ppp+pppoe trio of protocol headers was used to connect a router to a network node, a protocol converter, somewhat further upstream belonging either to the isp or to a wholesale long-distance carrier who in turn connects to the isp\\'s ip networks and then to the internet. the first use-case, router-to-modem connection, involving so-called ‘pppoeoe\\' (the pppoe protocol trio over a physical ethernet lan), is still very much in use today for connecting modems to routers if ppp is used. the second use-case, where the pppoe protocol trio is used over one or more internet access links reaching upstream to a greater or lesser depth, is, according to consensus, only still used for historical reasons. however since ppp remains popular with some isps either as a tunnelling protocol, needed where an isp uses a wholesale access carrier/reseller or because the features of ppp re desired, or both. as mentioned earlier, strangely, ethernet mac headers are in fact sometimes found in use with pppoe headers even when the ethernet protocol is not in use, not physically present on an ethernet network. this seems to serve no purpose apart from adding further unnecessary header overhead, so-called bloat. for example in the case, discussed below, of pppoeoa, where there was no physical ethernet, only atm, not only an unnecessary ethernet mac layer of header overhead was added but also an additional ethernet adaptation layer too to make ethernet fit on top of atm. in the second use-case, these additional protocol headers add a serious amount of bloat and so harm performance by a small amount. in the second use case, the use of ppp+pppoe+ethernet mac extends to a variable distance upstream. it may be confined to the ‘first mile\\': a copper twisted pair in adsl or vdsl2/fttc involving modems and no further, or it may also be used further upstream extending to a bras ‘broadband remote access server\\' or ‘access concentrator\\' which may or may not handle login but will certainly be a protocol convertor of some sort. in one example case pppoe extends upstream to and terminates at such a node operated by a wholesale carrier which converts to the l2tp tunneling protocol which tunnels to the isp\\'s ip pops (‘point of presence\\'). stages the pppoe has two distinct stages: pppoe discovery since traditional ppp connections are established between two end points over a serial link or over an atm virtual circuit that has already been established during dial-up, all ppp frames sent on the wire are sure to reach the other end. but ethernet networks are multi-access where each node in the network can access every other node. an ethernet frame contains the hardware address of the destination node (mac address). this helps the frame reach the intended destination. hence before exchanging ppp control packets to establish the connection over ethernet, the mac addresses of the two end points should be known to each other so that they can be encoded in these control packets. the pppoe discovery stage does exactly this. it also helps establish a session id that can be used for further exchange of packets. ppp session once the mac address of the peer is known and a session has been established, the session stage will start. pppoe discovery (pppoed) although traditional ppp is a peer-to-peer protocol, pppoe is inherently a client-server relationship since multiple hosts can connect to a service provider over a single physical connection. the discovery process consists of four steps between the host computer which acts as the client and the access concentrator at the internet service provider\\'s end acts as the server. they are outlined below. the fifth and last step is the way to close an existing session. client to server: initiation (padi) padi stands for pppoe active discovery initiation. if a user wants to \"dial up\" to the internet using dsl, then their computer first must find the dsl access concentrator (dsl-ac) at the user\\'s internet service provider\\'s point of presence (pop). communication over ethernet is only possible via mac addresses. as the computer does not know the mac address of the dsl-ac, it sends out a padi packet via an ethernet broadcast (mac: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff). this padi packet contains the mac address of the computer sending it. example of a padi-packet: frame 1 (44 bytes on wire, 44 bytes captured) ethernet ii, src: 00:50:da:42:d7:df, dst: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff ppp-over-ethernet discovery version: 1 type 1 code active discovery initiation (padi) session id: 0000 payload length: 24 pppoe tags tag: service-name tag: host-uniq binary data: (16 bytes) src. (=source) holds the mac address of the computer sending the padi. dst. (=destination) is the ethernet broadcast address. the padi packet can be received by more than one dsl-ac. only dsl-ac equipment that can serve the \"service-name\" tag should reply. server to client: offer (pado) pado stands for pppoe active discovery offer. once the user\\'s computer has sent the padi packet, the dsl-ac replies with a pado packet, using the mac address supplied in the padi. the pado packet contains the mac address of the dsl-ac, its name (e.g. leix11-erx for the t-com dsl-ac in leipzig) and the name of the service. if more than one pop\\'s dsl-ac replies with a pado packet, the user\\'s computer selects the dsl-ac for a particular pop using the supplied name or service. here is an example of a pado packet: frame 2 (60 bytes on wire, 60 bytes captured) ethernet ii, src: 00:0e:40:7b:f3:8a, dst: 00:50:da:42:d7:df ppp-over-ethernet discovery version: 1 type 1 code active discovery offer (pado) session id: 0000 payload length: 36 pppoe tags tag: ac-name string data: ipzbrool tag: host-uniq binary data: (16 bytes) ac-name -> string data holds the ac name, in this case \"ipzbr001\" (the arcor dsl-ac in leipzig) src. holds the mac address of the dsl-ac. the mac address of the dsl-ac also reveals the manufacturer of the dsl-ac (in this case nortel networks). client to server: request (padr) padr stands for pppoe active discovery request. a padr packet is sent by the user\\'s computer to the dsl-ac following receipt of an acceptable pado packet from the dsl-ac. it confirms acceptance of the offer of a pppoe connection made by the dsl-ac issuing the pado packet. server to client: session-confirmation (pads) pads stands for pppoe active discovery session-confirmation. the padr packet above is confirmed by the dsl-ac with a pads packet, and a session id is given out with it. the connection with the dsl-ac for that pop has now been fully established. either end to other end: termination (padt) padt stands for pppoe active discovery termination. this packet terminates the connection to the pop. it may be sent either from the user\\'s computer or from the dsl-ac. protocol overhead pppoe is used to connect a pc or a router to a modem via an ethernet link and it can also be used in internet access over dsl on a telephone line in the pppoe over atm (pppoeoa) over adsl protocol stack. pppoe over atm has the highest overhead of the popular dsl delivery methods, when compared with for example pppoa (rfc 2364). use with dsl - pppoe over atm (pppoeoa) the amount of overhead added by pppoeoa on a dsl link depends on the packet size because of (i) the absorbing effect of atm cell-padding (discussed below), which completely cancels out additional overhead of pppoeoa in some cases, (ii) pppoeoa + aal5 overhead which can cause an entire additional 53-byte atm cell to be required, and (iii) in the case of ip packets, pppoe overhead added to packets that are near maximum length (‘mru\\') may cause ip fragmentation, which also involves the first two considerations for both of the resulting ip fragments. however ignoring atm and ip fragmentation for the moment, the protocol header overheads for atm payload due to choosing ppp + pppoeoa can be as high as 44 bytes = 2 bytes (for ppp) + 6 (for pppoe) + 18 (ethernet mac, variable) + 10 (rfc 2684 llc, variable) + 8 (aal5 cpcs). this overhead is that obtained when using the llc header option described in rfc 2684 for pppoeoa. compare this with a vastly more header-efficient protocol, ppp + pppoa rfc 2364 vc-mux over atm+dsl, which has a mere 10-byte overhead within the atm payload. (in fact, just simply 10 bytes = 2 bytes for ppp + zero for rfc 2364 + 8 (aal5 cpcs).) this figure of 44 bytes aal5 payload overhead can be reduced in two ways: (i) by choosing the rfc 2684 option of discarding the 4-byte ethernet mac fcs, which reduces the figure of 18 bytes above to 14, and (ii) by using the rfc 2684 vc-mux option, whose overhead contribution is a mere 2 bytes compared with the 10 byte overhead of the llc alternative. it turns out that this overhead reduction can be a valuable efficiency improvement. using vc-mux instead of llc, the atm payload overhead is either 32 bytes (without ethernet fcs) or 36 bytes (with fcs). atm aal5 requires that an 8-byte-long ‘cpcs\\' trailer must always be present at the very end of the final cell (‘right justified\\') of the run of atm cells that make up the aal5 payload packet. in the llc case, the total atm payload overhead is 2 + 6 + 18 + 10 + 8 = 44 bytes if the ethernet mac fcs is present, or 2 + 6 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 40 bytes with no fcs. in the more efficient vc-mux case the atm payload overhead is 2 + 6 + 18 + 2 + 8 = 36 bytes (with fcs), or 2 + 6 + 14 + 2 + 8 = 32 bytes (no fcs). however, the true overhead in terms of the total amount of atm payload data sent is not simply a fixed additional value - it can only be either zero or 48 bytes (leaving aside scenario (iii) mentioned earlier, ip fragmentation). this is because atm cells are fixed length with a payload capacity of 48 bytes, and adding a greater extra amount of aal5 payload due to additional headers may require one more whole atm cell to be sent containing the excess. the last one or two atm cells contain padding bytes as required to ensure that each cell\\'s payload is 48 bytes long. an example: in the case of a 1500-byte ip packet sent over aal5/atm with pppoeoa and rfc2684-llc, neglecting final cell padding for the moment, one starts with 1500 + 2 + 6 + 18 + 10 + 8 (aal5 cpcs trailer) = 1544 bytes if the ethernet fcs is present, or else + 2 + 6 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 40 bytes with no fcs. to send 1544 bytes over atm requires 33 48-byte atm cells, since the available payload capacity of 32 cells × 48 bytes per cell = 1536 bytes is not quite enough. compare this to the case of ppp + pppoa which at 1500 + 2 (ppp) + 0 (pppoa: rfc 2364 vc-mux) + 8 (cpcs trailer) = 1510 bytes fits in 32 cells. so the real cost of choosing pppoeoa plus rfc2684-llc for 1500-byte ip packets is one additional atm cell per ip packet, a ratio of 33:32. so for 1500 byte packets, pppoeoa with llc is ~3.125% slower than pppoa or optimal choices of pppoeoa header options. for some packet lengths the true additional effective dsl overhead due to choosing pppoeoa compared with pppoa will be zero if the extra header overhead is not enough to need an additional atm cell at that particular packet length. for example, a 1492 byte long packet sent with ppp + pppoeoa using rfc2684-llc plus fcs gives us a total atm payload of 1492 + 44 = 1536 bytes = 32 cells exactly, and the overhead in this special case is no greater than if we were using the header-efficient pppoa protocol, which would require 1492 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 1502 bytes atm payload = 32 cells also. the case where the packet length is 1492 represents the optimum efficiency for pppoeoa with rfc2684-llc in ratio terms, unless even longer packets are allowed. using pppoeoa with the rfc2684 vc-mux header option is always much more efficient than the llc option, since the atm overhead, as mentioned earlier, is only 32 or 36 bytes (depending on whether this is without or with the ethernet fcs option in pppoeoa) so that a 1500 byte long packet including all overheads of ppp + pppoeoa using vc-mux equates to a total 1500 + 36 = 1536 bytes atm payload if the fcs is present = 32 atm cells exactly, thus saving an entire atm cell. with short packets, the longer the header overheads the greater the likelihood of generating an additional atm cell. a worst case might be sending 3 atm cells instead of two because of a 44 byte header overhead compared with a 10 byte header overhead, so 50% more time taken to transmit the data. for example, a tcp ack packet over ipv6 is 60 bytes long, and with overhead of 40 or 44 bytes for pppoeoa + llc this requires three 48 byte atm cells\\' payloads. as a comparison, pppoa with overheads of 10 bytes so 70 bytes total fits into two cells. so the extra cost of choosing pppoe/llc over pppoa is 50% extra data sent. pppoeoa + vc-mux would be fine though: with 32 or 36 byte overhead, our ip packet still fits in two cells. in all cases the most efficient option for atm-based adsl internet access is to choose pppoa (rfc2364) vc-mux. however, if pppoeoa is required, then the best choice is always to use vc-mux (as opposed to llc) with no ethernet fcs, giving an atm payload overhead of 32 bytes = 2 bytes (for ppp) + 6 (for pppoe) + 14 (ethernet mac, no fcs) + 2 (rfc 2684 vc-mux) + 8 (aal5 cpcs trailer). unfortunately some dsl services require the use of wasteful llc headers with pppoe and do not allow the more efficient vc-mux option. in that case, using a reduced packet length, such as enforcing a maximum mtu of 1492 regains efficiency with long packets even with llc headers and, as mentioned earlier, in that case no extra wasteful atm cell is generated. overhead on ethernet on an ethernet lan, the overhead for ppp + pppoe is a fixed 2 + 6 = 8 bytes, unless ip fragmentation is produced. mtu/mru when a pppoe-speaking dsl modem sends or receives ethernet frames containing ppp + pppoe payload across the ethernet link to a router (or pppoe-speaking single pc), ppp + pppoe contributes an additional overhead of 8 bytes = 2 (ppp) + 6 (pppoe) included within the payload of each ethernet frame. this added overhead can mean that a reduced maximum length limit (so-called ‘mtu\\' or ‘mru\\') of 1500 − 8 = 1492 bytes is imposed on (for example) ip packets sent or received, as opposed to the usual 1500-byte ethernet frame payload length limit which applies to standard ethernet networks. some devices support rfc 4638, which allows negotiation for the use of non-standard ethernet frames with a 1508-byte ethernet payload, sometimes called ‘baby jumbo frames\\', so allowing a full 1500-byte pppoe payload. this capability is advantageous for many users in cases where companies receiving ip packets have (incorrectly) chosen to block all icmp responses from exiting their network, a bad practice which prevents path mtu discovery from working correctly and which can cause problems for users accessing such networks if they have an mtu of less than 1500 bytes. pppoe-to-pppoa converting adsl modem the following diagram shows a scenario where an ethernet-connected adsl modem acts as a pppoe-to-pppoa protocol converter and the service provider offers a pppoa service and does not understand pppoe. there is no pppoeoa in this protocol chain. this is an optimally protocol-efficient design for a separate adsl modem connected to a router by ethernet. in this alternative technology, pppoe is merely a means of connecting dsl-modems to an ethernet-only router (again, or to a single host pc). here it is not concerned with the mechanism employed by an isp to offer broadband services. the draytek vigor 110, 120 and 130 modems work in this way. when transmitting packets bound for the internet, the pppoe-speaking ethernet router sends ethernet frames to the (also pppoe-speaking) dsl modem. the modem extracts ppp frames from within the received pppoe frames, and sends the ppp frames onwards to the dslam by encapsulating them according to rfc 2364 (pppoa), thus converting pppoe into pppoa. {| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"float:center;padding-left:15px\" |+ dsl internet access

detailed, more service-provider specific diagram there would be additional table cells in this area. quirks since the point-to-point connection established has a mtu lower than that of standard ethernet (typically 1492 vs ethernet\\'s 1500), it can sometimes cause problems when path mtu discovery is defeated by poorly configured firewalls. although higher mtus are becoming more common in providers\\' networks, usually the workaround is to use tcp mss (maximum segment size) \"clamping\" or \"rewrite\", whereby the access concentrator rewrites the mss to ensure tcp peers send smaller datagrams. although tcp mss clamping solves the mtu issue for tcp, other protocols such as icmp and udp may still be affected. rfc 4638 allows pppoe devices to negotiate an mtu of greater than 1492 if the underlying ethernet layer is capable of jumbo frames. some vendors (cisco and juniper, for example) distinguish pppoe[oa] from pppoeoe (pppoe over ethernet), which is pppoe running directly over ethernet or other ieee 802 networks or over ethernet bridged over atm, in order to distinguish it from pppoeoa (pppoe over atm), which is pppoe running over an atm virtual circuit using rfc 2684 and snap encapsulation of pppoe. (pppoeoa is not the same as point-to-point protocol over atm (pppoa), which doesn\\'t use snap). according to a cisco document \"pppoeoe is a variant of pppoe where the layer 2 transport protocol is now ethernet or 802.1q vlan instead of atm. this encapsulation method is generally found in metro ethernet or ethernet digital subscriber line access multiplexer (dslam) environments. the common deployment model is that this encapsulation method is typically found in multi-tenant buildings or hotels. by delivering ethernet to the subscriber, the available bandwidth is much more abundant and the ease of further service delivery is increased.\" it is possible to find dsl modems, such as the draytek vigor 120, where pppoe is confined to the ethernet link between a dsl modem and a partnering router, and the isp does not speak pppoe at all (but rather pppoa). post-dsl uses and some alternatives in these contexts a certain method of using pppoe in conjunction with gpon (which involves creating a vlan via omci) has been patented by zte. pppoe over gpon is reportedly used by retail service providers such as internode of australia\\'s national broadband network, orange of france, the philippines\\' globe telecom and italy\\'s aruba ftth on openfiber public gpon networks. rfc 6934, \"applicability of access node control mechanism to pon based broadband networks\", which argues for the use of access node control protocol in pons for—among other things—authenticating subscriber access and managing their ip addresses, and the first author of which is a verizon employee, excludes pppoe as an acceptable encapsulation for gpon: \"the protocol encapsulation on bpon is based on multi-protocol encapsulation over atm adaptation layer 5 (aal5), defined in [rfc2684]. this covers ppp over ethernet (pppoe, defined in [rfc2516]) or ip over ethernet (ipoe). the protocol encapsulation on gpon is always ipoe.\" the 10g-pon (xg-pon) standard (g.987) provides for 802.1x mutual authentication of the onu and olt, besides the omci method carried forward from g.984. g.987 also adds support for authenticating other customer-premises equipment beyond the onu (e.g. in a mdu), although this is limited to ethernet ports, also handled via 802.1x. (the onu is supposed snoop eap-encapsulated radius messages in this scenario and determine if the authentication was successful or not.) there is some modicum support for pppoe specified in the omci standards, but only in terms of the onu being able to filter and add vlan tags for traffic based on its encapsulation (and other parameters), which includes pppoe among the protocols that onu must be able to discern. the broadband forum\\'s tr-200 \"using epon in the context of tr-101\" (2011), which also pertains to 10g-epon, says \"the olt and the multiple-subscriber onu must be able to perform the pppoe intermediate agent function, as specified in section 3.9.2/tr-101.\" a book on ethernet in the first mile notes that dhcp can obviously be used instead of pppoe to configure a host for an ip session, although it points out that dhcp is not a complete replacement for pppoe if some encapsulation is also desired (although vlan bridges can fulfill this function) and that furthermore, dhcp does not provide (subscriber) authentication, suggesting that ieee 802.1x is also needed for a \"complete solution\" without pppoe. (this book assumes that pppoe is leveraged for other features of ppp besides encapsulation, including ipcp for host configuration, and pap or chap for authentication.) there are security reasons to use pppoe in a (non-dsl/atm) shared-medium environment, such as power line communication networks, in order to create separate tunnels for each customer. pppoe is widely used on wan lines, including fttx. many fttx residential gateway provided by isp has integrated the routing functions. see also multiprotocol encapsulation over atm point-to-point protocol daemon point-to-point tunneling protocol point-to-point protocol over atm (pppoa) point-to-point protocol over x (pppox) references external links - a method for transmitting ppp over ethernet (pppoe) - layer 2 tunneling protocol (l2tp) active discovery relay for ppp over ethernet (pppoe) - accommodating a maximum transit unit/maximum receive unit (mtu/mru) greater than 1492 in the point-to-point protocol over ethernet (pppoe) - ppp over ethernet (pppoe) extensions for credit flow and link metrics us patent 6891825 - method and system of providing multi-user access to a packet switched network tr-043 - protocols at the u interface for accessing data networks using atm/dsl, issue 1.0, august 2001 1999 in technology tunneling protocols logical link control wide area networks ethernet',\n",

       " 'pollokshaws football club was a scottish football team, based in pollokshaws, now part of glasgow (at the time a separate burgh). history the club was founded on 18 april 1884, at a meeting at the town hall, as a merger between the pollok and sir john maxwell clubs; william m\\'neil, the match secretary of the maxwell, was kept on as match secretary for the new club. the club was the second club with the pollokshaws name, the original club lasting from 1876 to 1878. the new club entered the scottish cup and the renfrewshire cup for the 1884-85 season. in the former competition, the club received a bye in the first round, and after two draws against southern of greenock in the second, the club (in accordance with the competition\\'s rules) was given a third-round place. the club\\'s run ended with a 4-0 defeat at thornliebank. one week after the thornliebank defeat, pollokshaws gained a measure of comfort with its equal biggest-ever win in competitive football, beating houston athletic 14-0 in the renfrewshire cup, but the club lost in the second round to olympic of paisley. for some reason the club did not enter the 1885-86 scottish cup, only the renfrewshire, losing again to thornliebank. its best run in the renfrewshire came in 1886-87, two wins (one of which was a splendid 5-3 win at st mirren, coming from 3-2 down at half-time, despite injury reducing the side to 10 men, and having to play into a stiff wind) and a bye taking it into the quarter-finals, where the club took abercorn to a replay; abercorn went on to win the competition. the club had some fervid support at the time - at christmas 1886, after abercorn had beaten pollokshaws in the renfrewshire cup replay, two ironworkers were accused of assaulting a tramway car conductor who had \"made a disparaging remark\" about the club, and one was sentenced to 30 days\\' imprisonment. the club only won two ties in the main rounds of the scottish cup - another 14-0 win, this time against carlton of greenock, in 1888-89, and 3-1 against dykebar the following year - and did not win through to the main rounds after the introduction of qualifying rounds in 1891-92, falling one round short in 1892-93. indeed, in the first qualifying round in 1891-92 the club suffered its biggest cup defeat, 12-0 at ayr, ten goals coming in the second half as the \\'shaws had to face an \"incessant downpour\". from 1889 to 1890, the club moved from the renfrewshire fa to the glasgow football association and started to enter the glasgow cup instead, but in seven entries only won one tie, 3-1 at rutherglen in 1890-91 - the third \\'shaws goal provoking a \"free fight\" in the crowd, which \"did not interfere with the progress of the game\". the lack of success meant that the club was overlooked for membership in either the scottish league or the scottish football alliance. the club, therefore, got together with a number of others to found the scottish football federation in 1891. the competition lasted for two seasons, pollokshaws finishing mid-table in both, recording three double-digit wins - 13-3 win over burnbank swifts in march 1892, 14-1 over clydebank in november 1892, and 10-2 over falkirk in january 1893 - but the federation closed at the end of the 1892-93 season. the federation had proved to be a financial drain, given the distances involved and the £5 guarantee for visiting sides, and the clubs agreed to dissolve the federation to start a new, smaller, competition, for ten clubs, to be called the scottish football combination; pollokshaws was one of the seven clubs accepted. however the combination never started, as, after the scottish league absorbed many of the alliance members in its new second division, four of the six combination clubs (albion rovers, wishaw thistle, arthurlie, and royal albert) joined the alliance instead. a fifth club - motherwell - joined the league itself. without a league competition, pollokshaws withered. the club\\'s last recorded competitive match, against rangers in the 1893-94 glasgow cup, ended in an 11-0 defeat; its last recorded friendly match, at vale of leven in april 1894, ended in a 7-0 defeat. pollokshaws entered both the scottish cup and glasgow cup in 1894-95 but withdrew from both before playing a tie, and the club was formally struck off before the 1895-96 season. colours the club originally wore red jerseys and white knickerbockers, with a black and white hose. in 1889 the club changed to red and white vertical stripes, with blue knickers. grounds the club originally played at broom park, cowglen. in 1889 the club moved to maxwell park. nickname the media referred to the club as the \\'shaws, but also as the queer folk, taken from the nickname given to flemish weavers who came to the area in the 17th century. external links scottish cup results (nb: 1877-78 fixture relates to the earlier pollokshaws club;

       " 'the democratic party of albania (, pd or pdsh) is a conservative political party in albania. it has been the largest opposition party in the country since 2013. the democratic party of albania was founded in 1990 as a strongly anti-communist party with the majority of its followers being from politically persecuted dissidents of the communist dictatorial regime of enver hoxha. in international relations, it is an associate member of the european people\\'s party and a full member of international democrat union. history foundation the democratic party was founded on 12 december 1990 with major involvement from avdyl matoshi, azem hajdari, sali berisha and gramoz pashko, and arben imami, edmond budina, eduart selami, genc ruli, merita zaloshnja, aleksandër meksi involved only in the early stages of the formation of the party. it is the first opposition party in albania after more than 45 years of a communist leadership. the party was created as an anti-communist movement. 1991: first pluralist elections the first pluralist would be the first elections since 1923 to allow more than one party. the ruling labour party of albania during the 1991 elections had the biggest advantage during the election. including the influence over the media. there was no opportunity for the democratic party and other anti-communist parties in the election to influence the rural country side. the democratic party platform had promised the transformation of living standards through membership in the european community, strong connection with the united states and other western nations, gastarbeiter in german factories abroad, and immediate steps towards a free-market economy. which resulted in the democratic party coming in second place in results. the democratic party would ultimately win in the next election. 1992: second pluralist parliamentary presidential elections the democratic party of albania won the parliamentary elections of 22 march 1992, the second free and fair elections after many decades of mandatory and single communist party candidate elections. sali berisha its leader was elected as the second president of albania, which at the time had executive powers, and aleksandër meksi as prime minister. sali berisha with significant contribution in the formation of the party, and aleksandër meksi with minor contribution. the second pluralist government of albania governed by the democratic party and its leader was tasked with executing reforms to turn the country from a communist style everything in the hands of the government rule into a democratic country based in free markets, property rights, individual rights, and without interference of the government in the private lives of its citizens. 1996 presidential elections four years after the second free and fair elections, new free and fair election in respect to the new constitution of albania adopted in 1991, conform other democratic western and european countries were due. the elections were held on 26 may 1996. the main and well known political leaders of the party that governed the republic of albania for more than 45 years, under a ruthless regime, were no longer a major participant in the election. however, the party itself and its new and less known leaders at the time of the former labor party, the main political party during the communist regime was reformed, changed its platform conform to other parties that held the same believes, mainly left-wing philosophies, conform democratic standards, and its name to the socialist party of albania. it was the only serious opponent and challenger to the democratic party of albania in the 26 may 1996 presidential elections. during these elections the international election observers were limited in numbers. the democratic party of albania and its allies were able to win more than 71 seats in the parliament, on the presidential election of 26 may 1996, enough to form the majority and stay in government. sali berisha and aleksandër meksi respectively remained president and prime minister of the republic of albania, until new parliamentary election were called due to the ponzi-schemes crisis, held on 29 june 1997. 1997 parliamentary elections the ponzi-schemes lead to civil unrest that culminated in early spring of 1997. the crisis was deeply severe. the government led by the democratic party of albania and its leader due to civil unrest was not able to function properly in many parts of the country, especially in the south of albania. the fact that these ponzi-schemes were endorsed by the government (led by the democratic party of albania) or suggested people to invest in these schemes and the majority of the people who invested in these ponzi-schemes blamed the democratic party\\'s government for the failure of the ponzi-schemes. as a result of this crisis and internal civil unrest new parliamentary election were called on 29 june 1997 to sooth the situation. as a result of these elections the democratic party of albania lost its elections to its opposition party, socialist party of albania. a little more than a year after the socialist party of albania took control of the government on 12 september 1998 azem hajdari one of the founding members of the democratic party of albania and a very important political figure within the party was assassinated. his assassination lead to further unrest in albania. the democratic party of albania was in opposition and its leader, the former president of albania (with executive powers), who was in the leadership of the party during this time, sali berisha, accused the government of the socialist party of albania as the perpetrator of the assassination of azem hajdari. 2001 parliamentary elections on 24 june 2001 the next parliamentary elections on the due date as provided by the constitution were held. these elections were also lost by the democratic party of albania although not as deeply as the previous elections. the democratic party alleged irregularities and did not accept the result of the elections. odhir and osce which were involved in monitoring the elections and as an independent party declared on their final report that the elections were marked by irregularities and that repeated voting in some electoral zones increased the violations and irregularities of the election. to what extent these irregularities and violations helped the socialist party of albania win in such a wide range was not determined or conclusive in the election report. 2005 parliamentary elections in the 2005 parliamentary elections, the democratic party won 56 of the 140 seats and its allies won 18 under the call time to change (koha per ndryshim). two other parties also joined the new coalition (paa of the left wing & pbdnj of the greek minority, with 4 and 2 seats, respectively). this meant that with a combined total of 79 seats, the democratic party and its allies were able to form a government with sali berisha becoming prime minister. one of his priorities was albanian integration to nato, an objective he accomplished in 2009 when albania and croatia were accepted as members. the biggest tragedy after albanian civil war happened in saturday 15 march 2008 which is known as 2008 gërdec explosions . officially, albanian authorities confirmed 26 deaths in the explosions. officials report the number of injured people at over 300. according to figures published by the prime minister\\'s office, 2,306 buildings were damaged or destroyed in the explosions. of these, 318 houses were destroyed completely, 200 buildings were seriously damaged, and 188 buildings were less seriously damaged. 2009 parliamentary elections on 28

alliance consisted of mostly right wing parties. shortly before the election the ethnic greek unity party had switched to join the center left alliance of edi rama unification for change (bashkimi për ndryshim). due to the pdiu, a party representing the interest of cham albanians whose properties in greece were seized after the second world war. nevertheless the democratic party with its alliance had won 70 out of the 140 seats. it was unclear whether the democratic party and its alliance had won 70 or 71. on 4 july 2009, ilir meta leader of lsi announced he had accepted a deal to form a working majority coalition. making pd and its alliance have 74 out of 140. 2013 parliamentary elections after the defeat in the 2013 parliamentary election, berisha announced his resignation as party leader. a one-member-one-vote election was held for the first time on 23 july 2013, in which lulzim basha defeated his opponent sokol olldashi and was elected chairman of the democratic party. on 30 september 2014, a national congress of the democratic party was held to elect a new leadership and to announce a tough reform of the party. on the 26th anniversary of the democratic party, party leader basha announced his program for the further modernization and democratisation of the party ahead of the 2017 parliamentary elections. after previously promising that 35% of the parliamentary candidates would consist of members from the youth movement of the party, basha now announced a limitations of all mandates of the party leaders to a two-year term, and the full democratisation of the internal election process. 2017 parliamentary elections on 18 february 2017 members of the democratic party and other opposition parties, under the leadership of basha pitched a giant tent outside the prime minister\\'s office in tirana after thousands of protesters rallied to demand free elections and a technocrat government. the opposition protest further escalated into a larger political conflict. the democratic party and its allies refused to register to take part in the 25 june general election, until the government will accept their conditions to secure a free and democratic election. 2021 parliamentary elections on 16 february 2019 the albanian opposition led by lulzim basha protested for three years under his leadership, with the goals of removing edi rama from power. the opposition coalition consists of the democratic party (pd), the socialist movement for integration, the party for justice, integration and unity, the republican party and other minor opposition parties. after the first protests opposition mps decided to resign in mass from parliament, more than 40 seats were vacated. due to the protests the opposition parties decided to boycott the local elections that were previously set to be held on 30 june 2019. lulzim basha formed an alliance with minority parties, forming the democratic party alliance for change (partia demokratike - aleanca për ndryshim). however this was not enough to deliver the democratic party a victory, it did however increase its seats in parliament and the 2021 albanian parliamentary election would be the third loss in a row for the democratic party. following the election aftermath sali berisha had been declared persona non grata by the united states. which resulted in lulzim basha expelling berisha from the parliamentary group and begun causing party internal fighting between members of basha\\'s faction and berisha\\'s faction. on 11 december at arena kombëtare, the berisha faction held a national council to remove basha and his members from the party leadership. more than 4,446 voted for the removal of lulzim basha from party leader of the democratic party. however, basha did not recognize the results and the party internal feuds continued. on 6 march 2022 partial local elections for specifically, shkodër, durrës, dibër, vorë, rrogozhinë, and lushnjë. many supporters had left to support

place in shkodër. following the defeats in the partial local elections, lulzim basha stepped down which resulted in sali berisha and enkelejd alibeaj having disputes over leadership of the party. although not just alibeaj and berisha, members of berisha\\'s factions as well began to have disputes between each other, specifically between belind këlliçi and evi kokalari. këlliçi had accused kokalari that she had been attacking him and claimed that \"kokalari took time to hit me with some of the accusations and slanders used by the socialists against me.\" as a result këlliçi had taken kokalari to trial and responded to the accusations that evi kokalari has made against him with a defamation lawsuit, where he demands 1 million lek in compensation. on 7 july 2022 a big protest was held in tirana in front of the prime minster\\'s office, sali berisha as defacto chairman of the party had called it weeks before. the protest was called under the motto and slogan \"albania in danger\" (shqipëria në rrezik). sali berisha stated that the future of albania and the albanians was at risk and the stake of the fatherland was in their hands. on 17 may 2023 enkelejd alibeaj resigned from every post of the democratic party of albania. gazment bardhi would succeed alibeaj which would continue the party split. on 24 may 2023 lulzim basha would make an appearance claiming he was the leader of the democrats again succeeding bardhi who served as interim. headquarters the party\\'s headquarters are located in tirana, capital city of albania, not too far away from the

       " 'mrs. munger\\'s class is two seasons of brief, 90-second skits on disney\\'s one saturday morning on abc that featured the talking heads of a middle school yearbook page. the kids in the photos would often exchange silly dialogue and insults, while mrs. munger would tell them to \"simmer down! simmer! simmer!\" the camera would focus on whoever was speaking on one part of the yearbook page and quickly pan to follow the dialogue. students would move between the pictures to interact with one another. the show was in black and white, but color was used on occasion (on field trips or to show cosmetics). pilot a 22-minute pilot was created but was unaired due to the uses of the word \"damn\" and a sub-plot about an r-rated movie. it also features brad, a character used later for the series centerville, from the same creative team as mrs. munger\\'s class. controversy although the school portraits used in the show were manipulated, collaged, and otherwise altered, the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit felt that there was still too much resemblance. as such, the plaintiffs claimed the photographs were used for entertainment without personality rights clearance. mrs. munger turned out to be mrs. kathleen foresman, who had taught at woodbridge middle school in the washington, d.c. suburb of woodbridge, virginia, in 1975 when her picture and those of her 6th grade students were taken for a page in a yearbook. she, and four of her former students, filed suit against disney on december 23, 1998. edward jackson, a computer engineer in san diego, had learned that his likeness was being used after his 10-year-old niece brought the similarity to his attention. jackson, a black kid, was outraged not only at the use of his photo, but at the \"buckwheat\"-like speech pattern of the character. the lawsuit was settled for undisclosed damages. after the lawsuit, maloney created the short-lived skit series centerville, which used the same premise of talking student photos. however, unlike its predecessor, the characters in centerville were not confined to a yearbook page and appear in different settings. adult characters mrs. munger (voiced by peter hastings): the teacher. she regularly urges the class to \"simmer\" when things get out of hand. when things get too much out of hand, she yells out, \"hey!\" although often expressing frustration toward the class, she generally manages to take things in stride. usually, each episode would end with her saying, \"good gravy!\" or \"oh for the love of (insert object)!\" susan weiner: the field hockey coach. appears as a substitute teacher in \"substitute teacher\" and attempts to teach fire safety in \"fire drill\". fern berkowitz: a woman who teaches creative movement to the students in

lance (voiced by rob paulsen): speaks only in pig latin. apart from cissy tattling, no one acknowledges this. gordon (voiced by cree summer): gordon generally utters sassy comebacks and one-liners. he finishes his quotes with \"ole!\" karyn (voiced by c.j. arabia): she is obsessed with death. artie (voiced by brett bauer): a new jersey kid. most of his statements are very simple, or even unrelated to the topic at hand. when asked to interpret an art piece, for example, he responds with \"i\\'m hungry and my feet hurt\". dawn (voiced by melissa samuels): the class kiss-up, who reveals that she is overcompensating for her parents that travel a lot. she often refers to her fellow students as \"the children\". her portrait is located directly next to mrs. munger\\'s. she is also implied to be jewish during the christmas episode. cissy (voiced by c.j. arabia): the tattletale. in field trip episodes, she often wears her girl scout uniform, numbered \"666\". yvonne (voiced by cree summer): a black liberal feminist, in tune with modern art and high culture. her responses usually pertain to oppression, social injustice and other common feminist complaints. grace (voiced by melissa samuels): she is the figurative punching bag of the class. she generally says \"cut it out!\" theodore (voiced by peter hastings): a generally clueless student who stalls, stutters and takes forever to answer a question, even then almost always giving the wrong answer. rock (voiced by rob paulsen): the class nerd. he doesn\\'t talk until late season 1, but only in object-subject-verb-style (yoda speak). rock is friends with lance and in the \"creative movement\" episode implies that he believes himself to be from another planet. amanda (voiced by c.j. arabia): a flower child. she likes to sing or recite poetry. most of her lines are sung. phoebe (voiced by melissa samuels): prone to random outbursts, stares the rest of the time. she brings her mom\\'s cosmetics to school in several season 2 episodes.

first day in the class, some of the students annoy him, and he retaliates by biting them. one-time students darryl: mahoot\\'s cousin, who appeared only in \"mahoot\\'s cousin\". he also says only

       " 'ravenswood school of arts is a heritage-listed school of arts at macrossan street, ravenswood, charters towers region, queensland, australia. it was built in 1884. it was added to the queensland heritage register on 21 october 1992. history the school of arts building is a timber hall, built in 1884 beside a former school of arts structure then used as a library. it became the principal theatre, cinema, and social venue of ravenswood and continued a series of facilities provided to the community of ravenswood since 1872. ravenswood was one of several important goldfields in which formed a major component in the development of north queensland. the need to access and exploit gold finds determined the path of railways, the establishment of related industries and commerce and the location of settlements. some of these were short lived \"rushes\", where tent and shanty townships disappeared almost as quickly as they rose. other settlements based on goldfields became established towns with government and civic buildings, shops and family homes and survived as such. a few became important centres, only to fade away as gold yields fell. ravenswood was one of these. the area was first settled by europeans following the establishment of bowen in 1861. pastoral runs were soon set up in the hinterland, including the area on which the ravenswood field was to develop. the first gold in north queensland had been found at star river in 1865 and triggered further exploration. gold was found at merri merriwa, the run on which the town of ravenswood stands, in 1867, although it was reported as being on the adjoining property of ravenswood, the name by which the field was always known. much of the gold initially found was in a triangle in and around three dry creeks which soon formed the focus for a tent and shanty settlement. ravenswood gold was in reefs and a small battery was first set up in 1869, followed by the lady marian mill in 1870. the settlement was also surveyed at this time, but by then the goldfield itself, and the buildings and streets already established, had shaped the town and the survey merely formalised what was already in place. this can still be seen clearly in the irregularity of the major streets. ravenswood was gazetted as a town in 1871. it was soon found that the gold at deeper levels was finely distributed in ore containing other minerals and was difficult to separate either by mechanical or chemical means. this required greater capital to fund various technologies for extraction. many miners left for other fields, such as charters towers, discovered in 1871 and which quickly overtook ravenswood as a gold producer and as the most important inland north queensland town. even so, ravenswood continued to prosper due to a steady, though reduced, production of gold, the discovery of silver at nearby totley in 1878 and as a commercial centre. by 1874, the town had a courthouse and police station, a post and telegraph office, a hospital and a school. in 1872, the first small school of arts was formed, providing a lending library, newspapers and a meeting place for its members and in 1875 a separate library building was constructed beside it. the first mechanics\\' institutes or schools of arts were established in britain in the early 1800s and were intended to assist self-improvement and to promote moral, social and intellectual growth, by providing lectures, discussions and lending libraries to a rising middle class. at the time there were no public libraries and books were expensive, so that access to books by borrowing as subscribers provided an important educational and recreational service. the first school of arts committee in queensland was established in brisbane in 1849 with the aim of \"the advancement of the community in literary, philosophic and scientific subjects\". as towns and districts became established, local committees were formed to establish schools of arts and they became one of the principal sources of adult education. ravenswood\\'s economy received a boost in the mid 1880s by the arrival of the railway in 1884 and the use of improved means to extract gold from ore. a new generation of public buildings began to replace those from the early days of the field, including a police station and courthouse, post office and hospital. in 1884, the current hall was built beside the library, presumably replacing the first small hall. in the late nineteenth century schools of arts expanded their aims to include the promotion of games of skill and intellectual amusements. the new hall provided the facilities for the staging of plays and concerts and became a focal point of entertainment for townspeople. it was used as a meeting hall, dance hall and a live theatre. an amateur dramatic society staged annual productions and a school concert and st patrick\\'s day concert were annual events. . in 1899, the new ravenswood company was formed by archibald laurence wilson who raised overseas capital, reopened old mines and used modern methods to rework tailings more efficiently. the shareholders recouped their investment in the first two years and this drew world-wide interest. it was the beginning of ravenswood\\'s most prosperous period, which lasted for several years. however, after 1908, the cost of extraction and continued exploration grew as returns lessened and after the end of world war i, it became apparent that it would not pick up again. in 1916 rail services were cut and in 1917 the new ravenswood company closed. in the 1920s, buildings as well as people left ravenswood, as timber buildings were relocated in other towns. there was a small revival in the 1930s and early 1940s as new technology allowed for economical mining of lower grade ores. however, by the 1960s, the population fell to 70. this was to be its lowest level, as tourists began to take an interest in the town, studies were made of the buildings and work began to conserve them. in the 1980s the whole town was listed by the australian heritage commission and the national trust of queensland. in 1987 carpentaria gold ltd opened a new open cut mine using modern heap leaching processes. in 1989 cyclone aivu damaged the facade of the hall and caused the complete collapse of the library. this building was propped by the community, but eventually demolished in 1992 as it was thought unsafe. the hall was repaired and the front reconstructed to resemble its original appearance. in 1990 the dalrymple shire council and carpentaria gold financed extensive renovations to the hall. its official opening took place on sunday 29 september 1991, since when it has again become a focus for community activities and celebrations including the \"back to ravenswood weekend\" held each year. description the school of arts is located on macrossan street, the main street of ravenswood. it is on the edge of the town\\'s commercial centre and close to the imperial hotel. ravenswood is located in a mining landscape which consists of disturbed ground with scattered ruins and mullock heaps, set amongst distinctive chinkee apples and rubber vines. the school of arts is a single storey, rectangular timber building set on low concrete stumps. it is rectangular in plan with its long axis at right angles to the street and has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. the sides and back have an exposed stud frame but the front is weatherboard clad. the facade is symmetrical and divided into bays by pilasters. the arched parapet is echoed by the arched heads of the central front door and the double hung windows which flank it. the interior features a large open space and a stage. the stage curtain has been preserved and is decorated with painted advertisements for local businesses dating from around the turn of the century, reflecting its use as a community building. heritage listing ravenswood school of arts was listed on the queensland heritage register on 21 october 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. the place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of queensland\\'s history. the ravenswood school of arts is important as an element in the network of schools of arts which sprang up in any town of consequence in queensland during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. they were community based and played a valuable educational and social role in the dissemination of information and the provision of facilities for lectures, meetings, games of skill and the staging of community events such as plays and concerts. the place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. it is a good example of a school of arts hall with a classically influenced facade and the provision of facilities for public events. the place is important because of its aesthetic significance. the building is a significant as part of the townscape of ravenswood because of its location within a group of other public and commercial buildings, close to the town centre. the place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. the painted stage curtain carrying advertisements for local firms around the turn of the century reflects its importance as a building used by the community. the school of arts is important for its connection with the community of ravenswood as an integral part of the social and community life of the town. references

       " 'the hatfield war memorial is a war memorial beside the great north road in hatfield, hertfordshire. it was one of 24 war memorials in england designed by sir herbert baker, that were designated as a national collection by historic england in 2017. the memorial is located near the gates of hatfield house, and close to hatfield railway station. it was unveiled in 1921, to commemorate 139 men from hatfield killed on service during the first world war. a brick pavilion records the names of the dead, with further names added after the second world war. the memorial comprises a portland stone memorial cross, standing within a garden surrounded by brick walls to the north, west and south sides, and a yew hedge to the east, with an entrance gate in the wall to the south. portland stone tablets with dedications listing the names of the dead are located in a brick shelter pavilion to the north side of the garden. the memorial cross is a typical baker design, with an octagonal cross section, standing on an octagonal base. baker had proposed a similar design of memorial cross to the imperial war graves commission (now commonwealth war graves commission), but a different design by sir reginald blomfield was selected instead: the cross of sacrifice familiar at many cwgc cemeteries. baker used versions of his cross in many of the municipal war memorials that he was commissioned to design after the first world war. he was also responsible for the design of 113 cemeteries on the western front, including tyne cot, delville wood south african national memorial and neuve-chapelle indian memorial. the central wheel-headed latin cross is decorated with roses and lilies representing england and france. it stands on an octagonal shaft and simple octagonal plinth, surrounded by a small octagonal pavement, in the centre of a grass lawn. a rectangular pavilion constructed of red brick stands to the north side of the garden, with three round-headed arches facing towards the cross in the south; the arches were later closed by metal railings. the hipped roof of the pavilion is covered with clay tiles, and the brick floor is laid in a herringbone pattern. the solid side and rear walls bear stone plaques with dedications and lists of names. baker used similar brick shelters at other memorials, including some for the cwgc on the western front. the portland stone plaques commemorate the 139 servicemen from hatfield killed during the first world war. the names of a further 58 men and women were added after the second world war, along with 34 civilians killed in the 503 bombing raids that affected the area, many targeting the de havilland aircraft factory nearby . the memorial was built on land to the east of the great north road, near the gates leading to hatfield house. the site was donated by james gascoyne-cecil, 4th marquess of salisbury. construction cost £1,500. the memorial was unveiled on 12 june 1921 by thomas brand, 3rd viscount hampden (the lord lieutenant of hertfordshire, who had commanded a battalion of the hertfordshire regiment) and dedicated by the bishop of exeter lord william cecil (the younger brother of the 4th marquess). the names of the dead were read out at the ceremony by lord salisbury. the names of a further 58 men and women were added after the second world war, along with the names of 34 civilians killed in the 503 bombing raids in the district. two further names were added in 2014. the memorial was repaired in 1998. the main column was heavily weathered by 2013, and it was replaced in 2015. the memorial became a grade ii listed building in may 2017. nearby are the grade ii listed gates leading to the grade i listed hatfield house and its grade i listed park, and a grade ii listed statue of robert gascoyne-cecil, 3rd marquess of salisbury, who served as prime minister of the united kingdom three times. see also grade ii listed war memorials in england grade ii listed buildings in hertfordshire references hatfield war memorial, national heritage list for england, historic england hatfield ww1 and ww2 memorial, imperial war museum hatfield war memorial, war memorials online war memorial, hatfield-herts.co.uk hatfield war memorial, hatfield town council hatfield war memorial given special listed status, hatfield town council, 23 may 2017 two names have been added to the hatfield ww1 war memorial, our hatfield, 8 november 2013 buildings and structures completed in 1921 military history of hertfordshire monuments and memorials in hertfordshire stone monuments and memorials grade ii listed buildings in hertfordshire grade ii listed monuments and memorials world war i memorials in england world war ii memorials in england',\n",

       " 'old master q (; wong\\'s romanization: lo fu gee) is a hong kong manhua created by alfonso wong. the cartoon first appeared in the newspapers and magazines in hong kong on 3 february 1962, and later serialised in 1964. the comic is still in publication today, and is the oldest asian comic series in publication. the comic is copyrighted by wangz inc, a company established by joseph wong chak (alfonso wong\\'s eldest son) in taipei, taiwan. joseph wong still continues to create new volumes. name alfonso wong explained that (\"lo\") means \"old\", is \"a rather ordinary, but respectable title\" over two-thousand-year old which denotes a \"learned one\" \"who can become a teacher (\\'fu gee\\') or, or one who has studied a lot\"; the english title \"old master q\" \"sort of\" translates the chinese title, with q being abbreviated from earlier \"cute\". wong additionally noted the similarity between his main character\\'s english title \"old master q\" & the name ah q of lu xun\\'s character, whom wong considered to be \"rather and satirical\". characters the series\\' cast is led by old master q (), an elderly, lanky man dressed in a distinctive traditional chinese attire. the character is created to satire asian cultures in particularly backward conservatism, hubris, showing-off attitude, ungratefulness, rash, irresponsibility, weak-will, and even delusion. most of the time, he is depicted as a person who keep living in the past in the ever-changing and brutally unfair world where money is the absolute power. to highlight this, q is depicted in many short stories to mostly gets his rewards for being a good person in the form of being backstabbed; wrongfully accuse of wrongdoings as well as being hated for no apparent reasons. kelvin chan of the south china morning post described q as \"eccentric\". supporting characters include: big potato () old master q\\'s identically-dressed friend with a stumpy, big-headed build. mr. chin (, \\'ordinary joe\\' character, good friend with old master q and potato. miss chan (), old master q\\'s love interest. vain and gold-digging, she always see herself as the most beautiful woman alive and has a tendency to ditch w every time she gets her hands on some rich individuals. mr. chiu (), main antagonist to old master q, often pranking each other). he often depicted as an arrogant rich individual who looks down on people as well as being incredibly petty. format and themes the overall theme of the comics centres around humour, with characters usually portrayed in a variety of social statuses, professions and time periods, ranging from beggars and office workers to actors and ancient warriors, which allows for a wide variety of scenarios to explore. more outlandish situations incorporate surrealism, close encounters with aliens, ghost sightings, and the afterlife. while each comic is typically produced as short strips of four, six or twelve panels, longer comics have been produced revolving around lengthier adventures of the main cast pitted again gangsters in modern hong kong or warriors in a wuxia setting. while old master q comics primarily focuses on humour, it also reflects changing social trends, particularly from the 1960s to the 1980s. the comics would sometimes feature societal problems in urban life, such as poverty, petty thefts and secret societies. it also poked fun at fashion, contemporary art and rock music. the comic strips sometimes also bemoan the decline of ethical or moral values in modern-day living. characters often display acts of selfishness or misery, although the comics occasionally display good values like filial piety. the language barrier between the chinese language and the english language is also depicted in some comic strips, illustrated with old master q\\'s difficulty communicating with foreigners, especially westerners. the comics have, on some occasions, expressed complexity in the plots and serious views on major political changes taking place in hong kong during the 1960s-1980s. it had previously criticised overly westernised chinese, who were often shown in the comic strips kowtowing to western interests over the local chinese interests. the run-up to the handover of hong kong to china following the sino-british joint declaration of 1984 also became a point of interest, as a few comic strips were published through the late 1980s and early 1990s expressing the characters\\' fears of handover, frequently represented in a numeral of the year it would take place: 1997. some of these comic strips also depict direct assault of representations of the chinese government and the chinese communist party, occasionally in the form of caricatured depictions of deng xiaoping. the handover was later depicted in more a positive light in the years leading to the actual event, possibly representing a changing perspective from the author. films the comic series was made into many cantonese and mandarin cartoon animations, one of which combined live actors and advanced cgi graphics. the list of old master q films is as follows, in chronological order: other actors in omq movies include: hong wei (紅薇), connie chan, nancy sit, chu yau-ko (朱由高), fen ni (芬妮) other lyricists/singers include: wong jim, joseph koo, leslie cheung spin-off a spin-off series called q master q (q夫子) shows young versions of the characters with similar clothing as their adult counterparts. each of their names also are related to their counterparts: plagiarism dispute some cartoonists and readers claim that the idea of old master q was actually created by peng di (朋弟) in the late 1930s and not alfonso wong, as some of whom were mostly professional mainland cartoonists alleged that peng di\\'s ideas were stolen by alfonso wong. they claimed that the cartoons first appeared in the newspapers and magazines in beijing (peking) and tianjin (tientsin). the character created by peng di was claimed to slightly resemble old master q which is currently being copyrighted by omq zmedia ltd. the character by peng di wore similar clothing and had a little similarity in personality to that of old master q. however, the formats, themes, and contents of the stories were different as old master q was not heavy with dialogue making it easy for foreigners around the world to immerse themselves in the story. a writer from tianjin published a book in 2001 containing samples of work by peng di, which displayed the similarities between peng di and alfonso wong\\'s works. the result of this dispute remains unclear as wangz inc. has denied all plagiarism accusations. references external links official english old master q site official chinese old master q site hong kong comics titles manhua

       " 'freshwater is a large village and civil parish at the western end of the isle of wight, england. the southern, coastal part of the village is freshwater bay, named for the adjacent small cove. freshwater sits at the western end of the region known as the back of the wight or the west wight, a popular tourist area. freshwater is close to steep chalk cliffs. it was the birthplace of physicist robert hooke and was the home of poet laureate alfred lord tennyson. landmarks freshwater is famous for its geology and coastal rock formations that have resulted from centuries worth of coastal erosion. the \"arch rock\" was a well-known local landmark that collapsed on 25 october 1992. the neighbouring \"stag rock\" is so named because supposedly a stag leapt to the rock from the cliff to escape during a hunt. another huge slab fell off the cliff face in 1968, and is now known as the \"mermaid rock\". immediately behind mermaid rock lies a small sea cave that cuts several metres into the new cliff. freshwater\\'s beach is very popular with tourists and locals. it is mostly pebbles, but it is also covered in chalk from the nearby cliffs, which is frequently gathered by tourists as souvenirs. freshwater features an excellent example of a surviving victorian beach hotel, the albion. the albion was built around the time freshwater became well-regarded as a coastal resort and is still popular today. frequent repair-work and repainting are undertaken on the building\\'s sea-front exterior walls, due to strong storms which often batter rocks, and other debris, against it. the hills above freshwater are named after tennyson. on the nearby tennyson down is a cornish granite cross erected in 1897 in tribute to tennyson, \"by the people of freshwater, and other friends in england and america.\" there is also a hill in the area called \\'hooke hill\\', named for robert hooke. the anglican all saints\\' church, freshwater is one of the oldest churches on the isle of wight, and it was listed in the domesday survey of 1086. mark whatson is the current pastor of all saints, which is in the anglican diocese of portsmouth. a primary school associated with the church is nearby. there is a marble memorial commemorating tennyson in all saints church. tennyson\\'s wife emily and other family members are buried in the church cemetery. the church is also the site of a memorial to tennyson\\'s son, lionel tennyson, who died of malaria in 1886. dimbola lodge, the home of julia margaret cameron and now a photographic museum, is in the village of freshwater bay, which is part of freshwater. there is also a tearoom and bookstore. tennyson\\'s son, hallam, donated land for a new church in freshwater bay. hallam\\'s wife audrey tennyson suggested that the church be named for st. agnes. st. agnes\\' church, freshwater was consecrated on 12 august 1908. it is the only thatched church on the isle of wight. freshwater was the site of the largest station on the freshwater, yarmouth and newport railway that operated from 20 july 1889 to 21 september 1953. a supermarket and garden centre now occupies the location of the former station. freshwater is near the source of the western yar, a river whose estuary runs north to yarmouth. freshwater marshes are a site of special scientific interest, and a large part of the marshes is also a local nature reserve called afton marshes. at the western end of freshwater bay on a bluff are the remains of fort redoubt, also known as fort freshwater or freshwater redoubt, a palmerston fort. fort redoubt was built in 1855-1856 to protect freshwater bay and was in use until the early 20th century; until the military sold it in 1928. presently, part of it is a private residence, and other portions are being developed as holiday flats. a doorway carved into the cliff below the fort was the main access to the building from the beach, although most of the iron stairway that formerly gave access has broken up due to the repeated actions of rust and the tide. two unusual structures that have been described as ice houses, pottery kilns or crematoria are found on moons hill in freshwater. robert walker was the first to excavate these features in the 1890s, and he thought they were evidence of a phoenician settlement in freshwater. chemical analyses suggest that they were most likely lime kilns. notable residents the renowned scientist robert hooke (1635-1703) was born in freshwater in 1635. his father john hooke was the curate of all saints church in freshwater. when hooke\\'s father died in 1648, hooke left freshwater for london to be apprenticed to portrait painter peter lely. after that, he went to westminster school and then oxford. painter george morland lived in freshwater in a structure known as the \"cabin\" around 1800. british poet laureate alfred lord tennyson lived at nearby farringford house (on the road between freshwater and alum bay). tennyson lived at farringford from 1853 until the end of his life in 1892. tennyson wrote of farringford: tennyson rented farringford in 1853 and then bought it in 1856. he found that there were too many starstruck tourists who pestered him in farringford, so he moved to \"aldworth\", a stately home on a hill known as blackdown between lurgashall and fernhurst, about south of haslemere in west sussex in 1869. however, he returned to farringford to spend the winters. pioneering photographer julia margaret cameron lived in freshwater at dimbola lodge from 1860 to 1875. gertrude fenton, the novelist and editor of the carisbrooke magazine, lived at lacey\\'s farm, freshwater in the early 1880\\'s. in 1960, dekyi tseri, mother of the current dalai lama, stayed at the guest house of sir basil gould\\'s widow cecily in freshwater for six weeks. tseri, known to tibetans as \"amala\", meaning \"the great mother\", was recuperating after a throat operation to remove a benign polyp performed at st. mary\\'s hospital in london. freshwater was also the birthplace of sir vivian ernest fuchs (11 february 1908 - 11 november 1999). an english explorer, and fellow of the royal society, whose expeditionary team completed the first overland crossing of antarctica in 1958. organisations the freshwater village association was created in november 2006. the freshwater village association was formed by freshwater residents who are concerned that freshwater might lose its identity as a village. the freshwater bay residents association was created on 2 july 1984, to express concern over the development of freshwater bay. freshwater lifeboat is an independent lifesaving organisation based in freshwater bay. it operates the freshwater bay lifeboat station on the promenade along freshwater bay and two lifeboats from public donations and profits from shop sales since it is not part of the royal national lifeboat institution. it hosts the freshwater and totland carnival every year. freshwater is the headquarters of the robert hooke society, who have created a walking trail around the area called the \"hooke trail\" to visit sites associated with him. they hold bi-monthly meetings at the island planetarium at fort victoria, a yearly memorial luncheon on 3 march on the date of his death and week-long celebrations of his birthday, 18 july. history there is evidence of a roman harbour at the end of the western yar. a romano-british grave containing a vectis ware pot was found on sheepwash farm in 1898. in 530 ad, the island fell to a combined force of saxons and jutes. after the norman conquest, lord of the island william fitz osbern gave the saxon all saints\\' church and its tithes to the norman abbey of lyre sometime between 1066 and his death in 1071. in 1414 all alien priories were seized by the crown. in 1623, when king james i gave freshwater parish to john williams, bishop of lincoln, williams then granted freshwater to st john\\'s college, cambridge on 24 march 1623. the freshwater parish originally was composed of five farms, known as \"tuns\": norton, sutton, easton, weston and middleton. all of these place names still exist, except for sutton, which is now called freshwater bay (previously freshwater gate). the first meeting of the freshwater parish council was on 31 december 1894. in 2010, 250 kg of cocaine was found in freshwater bay. the \"freshwater five\" fishing crew were convicted in relation to this, but are appealing their conviction. village attractions there are several attractions within the immediate area: farringford house, home of poet alfred lord tennyson. dimbola lodge, home of photographer julia margaret cameron. west wight sports centre. freshwater bay golf course. afton down, the site of the isle of wight festival 1970. the needles old battery, a victorian fort and post-second world war high down rocket test site. needles lighthouse and chalk rocks. compton bay, where dinosaur footprints are visible at low tide. the longstone, some four miles distant, the only megalithic monument on the island. not all of these attractions are within the formal boundaries of the village. transport freshwater is linked to other parts of the island by southern vectis buses on route 7 and route 12 serving totland, yarmouth and newport as well as intermediate villages. in the summer, open-top bus \"the needles tour\" and tourist service

       " 'the ps gem is a retired side-wheel paddle steamer that was first launched in 1876 on the murray river at moama, new south wales. she operated as a cargo and passenger steamer, regularly cruising between morgan and mildura. the gem operated as a tourist passenger vessel during the 1930s and 1940s, and was retired in the early 1950s. in 1962 the gem was sold to the then swan hill folk museum, where it would become a static display and historic monument. history launch and early life the gem was built in 1876 by air and westergaard in moama for elliot charles randell (brother of william richard randell, captain of the mary ann (1853), the murray\\'s first paddle steamer). built of red gum with iron frames, and expected to steam at 15 miles an hour, she was launched on 24 june 1876. the gem was initially used as a barge, and towed behind the ps pearl. she made her maiden voyage behind the pearl on 22 july 1876, leaving echuca for hay with a collective 22 tons of cargo and four passengers. it was reported in early 1877 that the gem and her sister barge ruby were to be fitted with steam engines (and additional decking) in echuca. the gem was fitted with a 40-horsepower engine built by davey bros. of ballarat, and work was completed on both steamers by 30 january 1877. it was august 1877 before the gem made her maiden voyage of some 1,063 river miles downstream to goolwa. she returned on 29 september, with a cargo of 180 cases of wine, before leaving once more on 11 october, this time for hay. it was reported in december 1877 that the gem and the ruby were to soon leave for goolwa, and due to the falling river were not expected to return until the following season, when the darling river would begin to fill. when the gem returned to echuca the following season, on 27 july 1878, she was offered for sale by public auction. though the reserve was not met, an invitation for private bids was released, and an announcement was later made that the vessel had been sold to e p sabine, a south australian river trader. the gem left echuca for the lower murray on 25 september, never to return. life on the lower murray the gem arrived at wentworth on 30 september 1878, and proceeded to travel regularly between there and blanchetown. this route was adjusted by january 1879, the gem then offering a regular service between wentworth and morgan (where the railway line from adelaide had recently opened). the ownership of the gem was transferred in april 1879 to captain hugh king (later known as \\'the grand old man of the river\\'), with whom a fortnightly trip from wentworth to wilcannia by the darling river was introduced. king and fellow owners w l reid and h reid, trading as hugh king and company\\'s line of river steamers, felt that the vessel had the potential to be a fine, large passenger steamer, though alterations would be necessary. by 10 february 1882, the gem had reportedly passed through mannum on her way to goolwa, where she would \"be cut in two and forty feet more in length put into her, which... [would] make her of a very much lighter draught\". upon arriving at yards of w gordon and son, the gem was cut in half, with each end being dragged apart by bullock teams. with the addition forty feet added to the centre, the new length of the vessel was . during this transformation, full passenger accommodation was also added. when the gem was relaunched on 22 june 1882, she became the longest paddle steamer on the murray river. the vessel returned to her regularly route between morgan and wentworth, though this was extended in 1888 following the establishment of the settlement of mildura. she was able to offer this service only from june to december, remaining laid up due to low river levels for the remainder of the year. during captain king\\'s time at the helm of the vessel, the gem suffered no serious accidents. in november 1888, the gem was acquired by a partnership of captain king and c chaffey, who a month later formed the river murray navigation company. the gem joined a fleet including its sister ruby, the ps ellen, and other paddle steamers. under this new ownership, the gem continued her regular cruising between morgan, wentworth and mildura. though essentially a passenger vessel, the paddle steamer still shared in the carriage of goods. in august 1895, the gem was carrying an average of 200 bales of wool per trip between rural stations and the rail head at morgan. in 1895 the river murray navigation company went in to liquidation, leaving king the gem sole owner. in late december 1903, the gem suffered an accident when the rudder chain jammed, resulting in the vessel running at full speed into a gum tree on the victorian bank. a portion of the guard rails and houses on the port side were damaged, though no one was injured. early 20th century during a visit to mildura in october 1909, sir thomas gibson-carmichael (the governor of victoria) travelled aboard the ps gem. on the morning of october 20, the governor and a party of fifty to sixty boarded the gem, visiting the junction of the murray and darling rivers, before continuing to wentworth. upon arrival at 2 o\\'clock, they were met by mayor w atkinson and visited a local primary school before returning to mildura by drays. toward the end of 1909, the gem navigation company was formed of king\\'s gem line of steamers and the ben chaffey steamboat company, with the gem joining a company of fourteen steamers and twenty barges. during most of the 1914-15 season the river level was low. the gem, having returned to the water from a regular overhaul on the goolwa slip, spent most of the season berthed. during this time, motor transport passenger services became more common and, due to the low river level, more reliable. the gem navigation company was one of several that, in an effort to sustain the declining river traffic, amalgamated in 1919 to become the murray shipping company. of the company\\'s fleet, the ps corowa was withdrawn from service in 1920, the ps ellen in 1925, and the ps ruby in 1928, leaving only the ps gem and the ps marion to continue the passenger service. during the 1930s and 1940s, the gem acted as a tourist passenger vessel, regularly undertaking the river journey from morgan to mildura. the gem would travel day and night, offering guests the chance to view the murray river under starlight. the paddle steamer boasted modern conveniences including hot and cold baths, electric lights and large cabins, as well as a first-class menu that included freshly caught murray cod. the gem also hosted a dining saloon, complete with fine crystal and silver. later life on 6 november 1948, the gem struck a snag near cal lal, new south wales, resulting in a break of the planking of the forward hold on the port side. captain g makin navigated the vesel toward the victorian bank, where she sunk in 15 feet of water. a line was run to a nearby tree to prevent the vessel slipping further into the water. the boat\\'s dinghy was used to ferry passengers to the new south wales bank, and the nearby kilcurna station lent their boat to assist in the removal of passengers. of the sixty passengers aboard, only one perished. c m smith, aged 73, was found in his cabin having died of shock (he was said to have \"been convalescing\"). the damage to the gem was not found to be excessive; her stern was slightly damaged and the hole in her side was eighteen by nine inches in size. the vessel was hauled onto dry land on the victorian bank for repairs, and she was refloated on 20 november. she was unable to travel under her own steam, and was towed to mildura for repairs. the repairs were finally completed by september 1949, at a cost of £3000. the gem was inspected and recommissioned, sailing from mildura downstream on 26 september 1949. despite this, regular services soon ceased, and then end for the gem came when the murray shipping company went into liquidation in 1952. after changing hands twice, the gem was purchased by a h wilkins, who had her taken on her final voyage under her own steam from morgan to mildura. here she remained tied up below lock 11. in 1962 the gem was sold to the swan hill folk museum (now the pioneer settlement) for £4000. she left mildura for the last time on 1 october 1962, towed by the ps oscar w. the journey was initially expected to take only ten days; however, due to the low state of the river the vessels were help up, the resulting journey taking nine months. the gem now rests within a dam at the pioneer settlement, without an engine. she\\'s had a range of uses since arrival, including being used as an art gallery, museum office, caretaker\\'s flat and australia\\'s first bush-tucker restaurant. in more recent years, the gem has been completely restored with fresh paint and upgrades, including the removal of all the art gallery and restaurant fittings. modern day both the engine and boiler of the ps gem were sold for scrap in 1956, with the remaining empty space being filled with equivalent weight ensuring the vessel\\'s flotation at correct angles and depth. prior to removal, the ps gem featured a static tangye steam engine as an unused example of its prior power. in 2023, the pioneer settlement celebrated the 60th anniversary of the paddlesteamer\\'s arrival to swan hill. a temporary exhibition aboard the vessel was launched, while a 13-minute audio-visual presentation documenting her final journey was projected upon the side of the vessel during evenings in july and august. references paddle steamers of australia 1876 ships victorian heritage register victorian heritage register loddon mallee (region) rural city of swan hill',\n",

       " 'jedi (jupiter energetic-particle detector instrument) is an instrument on the juno spacecraft orbiting planet jupiter. jedi coordinates with the several other space physics instruments on the juno spacecraft to characterize and understand the space environment of jupiter\\'s polar regions, and specifically to understand the generation of jupiter\\'s powerful aurora. it is part of a suite of instruments to study the magnetosphere of jupiter. jedi consists of three identical detectors that use microchannel plates and foil layers to detect the energy, angle, and types of ion within a certain range. it can detect electrons between 40 and 500 kev (kilo electron-volts), and hydrogen and oxygen from a few tens of kev to less than 1000 kev (1 mev). jedi uses radiation hardened application specific integrated circuits (asic)s. jedi was turned on in january 2016 while still en route to jupiter to also study interplanetary space. jedi uses solid state detectors (ssd\\'s) to measure the total energy (e) of both the ions and the electrons. the mcp anodes and the ssd arrays are configured to determine the directions of arrivals of the incoming charged particles. the instruments also use fast triple coincidence and optimum shielding to suppress penetrating background radiation and incoming uv foreground. jedi is designed to collect data on \"energy, spectra, mass species (h, he, o, s), and angular distributions\"; the plan is to study the energies and distribution of charged particles. it can detect them at between 30 kev and 1 gev, whereas jade, another instrument on the spacecraft, is designed to observe below 30 kev. one of the concepts being studied is that energy from jupiter\\'s rotation is being converted into its atmosphere and magnetosphere. it is radiation hardened to collect in situ data on the planet\\'s auroral magnetic field lines, the equatorial magnetosphere, and the polar ionosphere it was built by the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory (apl). one of the goals is to understand the aurora, and how particles are accelerated to such high speeds. one of the mysteries of jupiter is that x-rays are emitted from the poles, but do not seem to come from the auroral ring. each detector has a field of view of 120 degree by 12 degrees, and they are positioned to provide a 360 degree (a full circle) view of the sky along that axis. the juno spacecraft travels very rapidly in the close vicinity of jupiter (up to 50 km/s) and also spins very slowly (2 rpm). jedi can detected particles from 30 to 1000 kev including: electrons proton (hydrogen) ions helium ions sulfur ions oxygen ions energetic neutral atoms (ena\\'s) in relation to other space missions, an instrument on the earth-orbiting van allen probes (launched 2012), called rbspice, is nearly identical to jedi. this type of instrument is also similar to the pepssi instrument on new horizons (pluto/kupiter probe). jedi in combination with data from uvis detected electrical potentials of 400,000 electron volts (400 kev), 20-30 times higher than earth, driving charged particles into the polar regions of jupiter. a scientific paper juno observations of energetic charged particles over jupiter\\'s polar regions: analysis of monodirectional and bidirectional electron beams included results from a close pass over jupiter\\'s poles in august 2016 for electrons (25-800 kev) and protons (10-1500 kev). the paper analyzed electron angular beams in the auroral regions. see also gravity science is☉is (energetic particle detector on parker solar probe) jovian auroral distributions experiment (jade) jovian infrared auroral mapper (jiram) junocam (visible-light camera on juno orbiter) magnetometer (juno) (mag) microwave radiometer (juno) pluto energetic particle spectrometer science investigation swap (new horizons), measures the solar wind on the new horizons mission to pluto and beyond sweap (measures ions and electrons on the parker solar probe) uvs (juno) waves (juno) (radio and plasma wave instrument) references external links the jupiter energetic particle detector instrument (jedi) investigation for the juno mission (abstract link) juno (spacecraft) spacecraft instruments',\n",

       " 'the siege of pensacola included two separate attempts in 1707 by english-supported creek indians to capture the town and fortress of pensacola, one of two major settlements (the other was st. augustine) in spanish florida. the attacks, part of queen anne\\'s war (the north american theater of the war of the spanish succession), resulted in the burning of the town, and caused most of its indian population to flee, although the fort withstood repeated attacks. the battles were primarily fought in the nighttime hours due to the excessive heat of the day. the first siege, in august, resulted in the destruction of the town, but fort san carlos de austria successfully resisted the onslaught. in late november, a second expedition arrived, and made unsuccessful attacks on three consecutive nights before withdrawing. pensacola\\'s governor, don sebastián de moscoso, whose garrison was depleted by disease, recruited convicted criminals to assist in the fort\\'s defense. background english and spanish colonies in southeastern north america began coming into conflict as early as the middle of the 17th century. the spanish population of florida at the time was fairly small. since its founding in the 16th century, the spanish had set up a network of missions whose primary purpose was to pacify the local indian population and convert them to roman catholicism. the founding by english colonists of 1670 of charles town (present-day charleston, south carolina) in the recently established (1663) province of carolina heightened tensions. by the early 18th century, carolina traders like anthony dodsworth and thomas nairne had established alliances with creek indians in the upper watersheds of rivers draining into the gulf of mexico, who they supplied with arms and from whom they purchased slaves and animal pelts. these traders penetrated into spanish florida, leading to raiding and reprisal expeditions on both sides. in 1700, carolina\\'s governor, joseph blake, threatened the spanish that english claims to pensacola, established by the spanish in 1698, would be enforced. pierre le moyne d\\'iberville, the french founder of mobile, in january 1702, warned the spanish commander at pensacola that he should properly arm the apalachee indians and engage in a vigorous defense against potential english incursions into spanish territory. d\\'iberville even offered equipment and supplies for that purpose. however, an attempt at a punitive expedition against the creek resulted in a rout of the spanish and their apalachee allies in october, shortly before news of war declarations bringing the english government into the war of the spanish succession arrived. after a failed carolinian assault on st. augustine, spanish mission towns were severely reduced by numerous raids by combined creek-carolina raids against the spanish mission network from 1703 to 1706. a french-organized 1706 expedition against charles town was a failure but motivated carolina authorities to again target the spanish at pensacola and the french at mobile. nairne proposed a major expedition after the attack on charles town, intending to recruit as many as 1,500 indians to capture mobile, but political divisions in carolina prevented execution of the plan. first siege in 1707, pensacola was under the command of don sebastián de moscoso. the exact size of his garrison in 1707 is not known. the authorized strength of the garrison was 220, but it rarely reached that strength owing to the difficulty in recruiting soldiers, for what was viewed as a highly undesirable posting, and a fairly high rate of desertion. moscoso reported in 1708 that the garrison numbered about 100, having been reduced by the events of 1707. the garrison was housed in fort san carlos de austria, a wooden stockade fort built in 1698. extant records do not describe the composition of the forces that attacked pensacola in august beyond \"several hundred tallapoosas and a few south carolina traders\". the siege began on 12 august with the arrival of a band of 20 to 30 indians, who began terrorizing the indians living in the town outside the fort. they took prisoners (including some women and children) and began burning houses. governor moscoso fired one of the fort\\'s cannons, scattering the attackers; some of their captives managed to escape to the fort in the confusion. two days later, ten men sent out of the fort to do laundry disappeared. on 14 august an estimated 300 indians appeared before the fort and engaged it in a battle lasting several hours. the next day the attack resumed, as did the pillaging of the town. activity quieted down until 18 august, when an english flag was raised over a house near the fort. this prompted moscoso to open fire from the fort, beginning a battle that raged until dark. that day, the attackers burned down the rest of the town, and moscoso\\'s men had to work to prevent the fort from burning as well. while the spanish inspected the rubble, one of them was taken prisoner on 19 august and a second person was captured the next day. this marked the end of active assaults on the fort. however, the area beyond the range of the fort\\'s guns was unsafe for at least the next month; a number of people also disappeared after they ventured too far from its vicinity. second siege the second siege began with the arrival on 27 november of a contingent of about 20 carolina traders and 300 creeks, primarily tallapoosas and alabamas. on that day, a carolinian (unidentified in spanish reports, but possibly thomas nairne) brought a demand for surrender written in english. since none of the spaniards could read it, he was sent away, and the demand was eventually transmitted orally by a french huguenot. moscoso rejected the demand, even though his garrison was depleted by disease. the besiegers began an ineffectual attack on the fort around midnight which lasted until daybreak, at which point they delivered a final surrender demand which moscoso again refused. in order to supplement his forces, he successfully recruited convicts being held in the fort\\'s guardhouse to participate in the defense, offering them freedom and money for their service. during each of the next two nights the besiegers renewed their attacks on the fort, without significant effect. during the night of 29/30 november, one of the leading creek chiefs was killed. this apparently broke the besiegers\\' morale, for the siege was lifted the following morning. the attackers were reported to have suffered significant casualties. word of the attacking force had reached the french at mobile on 24 november. governor jean-baptiste le moyne de bienville raised a force of 100 frenchmen and 400 indians. they reached pensacola on 8 december, only to learn that the siege had been lifted a week earlier. aftermath these attacks were the last major assaults on pensacola in the war, although there continued to be minor skirmishes and kidnappings. most of the indians that fled during the sieges never returned, reducing pensacola to little more than its garrison. governor bienville learned from a spaniard who had escaped english captivity that mobile was also being targeted for attack. he improved mobile\\'s defenses in 1708, but the outpost was never attacked; a village of mobile indians was attacked in may 1709, however. a french force from mobile captured pensacola from the spanish in 1719, during the war of the quadruple alliance, but it was returned to spain after the war. the location of fort san carlos de austria is now occupied by fort barrancas, a national historic landmark whose construction began late in the 18th century. notes references further reading 1707 in north america pensacola 1707 battles of the war of the spanish succession conflicts in 1707 history of pensacola, florida queen anne\\'s war battles in florida sieges involving great britain sieges involving spain sieges of the war of the spanish succession spanish florida',\n",

       " 'dave sands (born david ritchie; 4 february 1926 - 11 august 1952) was an indigenous australian boxer. the man the americans called the \"boxer with the educated left hand\" received his due when he was inducted into the world boxing hall of fame in 1998 at a ceremony held in los angeles, recognised as one of the greatest boxers never to have won a world title. dave was the 2009 inductee for the australian national boxing hall of fame veterans category. early life born at burnt bridge mission kempsey, new south wales, fifth of eight children of george ritchie, a rodeo-rider and timber-cutter of mixed aboriginal and european descent, and his aboriginal wife mabel, née russell. sands\\' brothers clement, percival, george, alfred and russell also boxed, emulating their father and their maternal great-uncle bailey russell, a noted bare-knuckle fighter. in 1939 percy travelled to newcastle to train with tom maguire, at the age of 15 sands joined percy training with maguire and both lived at maguire\\'s gym. dave and his five brothers took on the sands name, taken off a train guard \"snowy\" sands who helped percy ritchie, travel to fight fare free in 1940. career without maguire\\'s knowledge, dave fought a four-round preliminary bout in august 1941 at newcastle stadium, swinging his way to victory in the first round. maguire disapproved, but quickly transformed him into a skilled boxer. by the end of 1942 he had knocked out a dozen opponents at newcastle. on 11 august 1945 he married 18-year-old bessie emma burns at st paul\\'s church of england, stockton, new south wales. sands was soon boxing in twelve-round matches before excited crowds of up to ten thousand people in brisbane and sydney. in may 1946 he defeated jack kirkham for the australian middleweight title. three months later he knocked out jack johnson in four rounds to become national light-heavyweight champion. the rematches were even more one-sided: kirkham was defeated in five rounds and johnson fell after 2½ minutes of furious punching. by 1948 sands had beaten all his local opponents and most american \\'imports\\'. his mauling of a french fighter tony toniolo in less than two minutes in february 1949 led the english promoter jack solomons to take an interest in him. despite an enthusiastic reception from the british press, sands began his campaign for a world title disastrously. in london on 4 april 1949, while suffering from a swollen, recently vaccinated arm, he was outpointed by tommy yarosz. fifteen days later sands won, dismally, against a spoiler, lucien caboche. maguire then moved him to newcastle-upon-tyne, where friendly locals and a promoter joe shepherd restored his confidence. after two solid victories, he returned to london and in july thrashed the much fancied robert villemain in the \\'fight of the year\\'. on 6 september sands demolished dick turpin in 2 minutes 35 seconds for the british empire middleweight title. shortly after his triumphal return to australia in november 1949, sands survived a serious accident when the steering on his motorcar failed and the vehicle somersaulted into a creek. over the next eighteen months he contested and won nine fights, one of them a fifteen-rounder in september 1950 in which he took the australian heavyweight championship from alf gallagher. sands had become a leading contender for the world middleweight title and maguire vainly sought to arrange a bout with the american champion sugar ray robinson. in the tricky maze of international boxing promotion, his efforts were marked by a paper chase of offers and counter-offers. sands defeated mel brown in london in july 1951 in a preliminary to a title fight between robinson and another contender randolph turpin. had maguire\\'s negotiations succeeded, sands would have been in turpin\\'s place and probably would have beaten an unfit robinson, as did turpin. in october 1951, sands won two fights in the united states. back home, he hoped for a world title-bout, but he was estranged from maguire. a new manager bede kerr reopened discussions with robinson\\'s connections, but the chance never came. death on 11 august 1952, the truck sands was driving with 15 passengers overturned at roadworks near dungog, new south wales. sands died of head and internal injuries that evening in the local hospital and was buried at sandgate cemetery, near newcastle, new south wales. his wife, and their son and two daughters survived him; their third daughter was born in november. sands had earned about £30,000, but it went on manager\\'s fees, travel costs, tax, family expenses and generosity to his kin. a public appeal raised more than £2500, sufficient to pay off his stockton home and create a trust fund for his family. professional boxing record titles references sources pictures held and digitised as part of the arnold thomas boxing collection by the national library of australia dave sands, empire and australian middleweight champion and tom maguire, trainer british empire title bout, dave sands, 11 st. 5 lb., k.o. dick turpin, 11 st. 3¾ lb., in the first round at harringay arena, england, 6 september 1949 dave sands (left), 11 st. 7¾ lb. v. henry brimm, 11 st. 5½ lb., at rushcutter\\'s bay stadium, 8 august 1950 external links 1926 births 1952 deaths indigenous australian boxers middleweight boxers people from kempsey, new south wales australian male boxers road incident deaths in new south wales sport australia hall of fame inductees',\n",

       " 'a boston cream pie is a cake with a cream filling. the dessert acquired its name when cakes and pies were cooked in the same pans, and the words were used interchangeably. in the late 19th century, this type of cake was variously called a \"cream pie\", a \"chocolate cream pie\", or a \"custard cake\". history it is said to have been created in 1856 by armenian-french chef mossburg sanzian at the parker house hotel in boston. a direct descendant of earlier cakes known as american pudding-cake pie and washington pie, the dessert was referred to as chocolate cream pie, parker house chocolate cream pie, and finally boston cream pie on parker house\\'s menus. the cake consisted of two layers of french butter sponge cake filled with thick custard and brushed with a rum syrup; its side was coated with the same custard overlaid with toasted sliced almonds, and the top coated with chocolate fondant. while other custard cakes may have existed at that time, baking chocolate as a coating was a new process, making it unique and a popular choice on the menu. the name \"chocolate cream pie\" first appeared in the 1872 methodist almanac. an early printed use of the term \"boston cream pie\" occurred in the granite iron ware cook book, printed in 1878. the earliest known recipe for the modern variant was printed in miss parloa\\'s kitchen companion in 1887 as \"chocolate cream pie\". boston cream pie is the official dessert of massachusetts, declared as such on december 12, 1996. variations a boston cream doughnut is a berliner filled with vanilla custard or crème pâtissière and topped with icing made from chocolate. the taiwanese version of the boston cream pie is a chiffon cake which does not include chocolate. see also list of american desserts list of cakes list of regional dishes of the united states references further reading external links \"has boston cream pie been manipulated beyond recognition? it\\'s a question with many layers.\" by kara baskin, the boston globe \"how boston cream pie changed americans\\' relationship with chocolate\" by atlas obscura american cakes chocolate desserts custard desserts layer cakes massachusetts cuisine symbols of massachusetts culture of boston',\n",
       " 'jigme singye wangchuck (, ; born 11 november 1955) is a member of the house of wangchuck who was the king of bhutan (druk gyalpo) from 1972 until his abdication in 2006. during his reign, he advocated the use of a gross national happiness index to measure the well-being of citizens rather than gross domestic product. early life jigme singye wangchuck was born in dechencholing palace in thimphu, bhutan, on 11 november 1955. to jigme dorji wangchuck and ashi kesang choden wangchuck. the political officer of india stationed in sikkim and the representative of the sikkimese government came soon after to offer felicitations to the royal parents and to pay their respect to the newborn prince. at the age of four, sometime in 1959, the young crown prince received the offerings of good wishes and respects by the public, monks, and officials for the first time in tashichho dzong. wangchuck received western and traditional learning in various institutions. he began studying at dechencholing palace, when he was six years old, in 1961. soon afterwards, he went to study at st. joseph\\'s school, darjeeling, in india. in 1964, he attended heatherdown school in england where he completed his studies in 1969. the next phase of his formal education took place at namselling palace in 1969. finally, he attended ugyen wangchuck academy at satsham choten in paro, which was established in 1970, along with a class of selected students from all over bhutan. crown prince in 1971 wangchuck\\'s father appointed wangchuck as the chairman of national planning commission, charged with the planning and co-ordination of the five year development plan. the following year, on 16 june 1972, he was made the trongsa penlop bestowing on him directly the saffron scarf or namza. the 3rd five-year plan (fyp), which spanned the period 1971-77, was in progress when his father died. wangchuck was 16 at that time. 1972 to 1976 was the period of the 3rd fyp, and 1976 to 1981 was the period of 4th fyp. as both king and the chairman of the national planning commission, the clearing house for the programmes and projects, wangchuck guided the planned activities first in broad terms and then increasingly in detail. royal wedding in a public ceremony, the royal wedding of wangchuck was held in dechog lhakhang in punakha dzong on 31 october 1988, corresponding with the descending day of buddha. the four queens, dorji wangmo wangchuck, tshering pem wangchuck, tshering yangdon wangchuck and sangay choden wangchuck are daughters of dasho yab ugyen dorji, the descendant of both the mind and speech incarnations of ngawang namgyal, and yum thuiji zam. previously, they had married privately in 1979. rural development in his coronation address on 2 june 1974, jigme singye stressed the need \"to attain self-reliance and preserve bhutan\\'s sovereignty and independence.\" he also stressed that any development undertaking should be a genuine collaboration between the people and the government. during the 1970s, immediate aims for rural households unfolded in terms of intensive valley projects, cash crops cultivation, especially potatoes - irrigation, and resettlement. enhancing the income and livelihood of the rural people were the main focus of the 3rd and 4th fyps. soon after he acceded to the throne, jigme singye launched the trashigang and tsirang intensive valley development projects in 1972. these projects were part of a larger vision of food self-sufficiency and income generation. encouraged by the achievements in the trashigang and tsirang intensive valley projects, similar valley projects were replicated in mongar and the newly created shumar (pemagatshel) districts. these projects were also sites of experimental and participatory decision making. it led to the formation of dzongkhag yargay tshogchungs (dyts), which brought the , gups and officials to prepare plans together. by 1981, trashigang and tsirang had fully functional dyts. in higher altitude areas a new initiative by wangchuck in early 1970s consisted of diffusing potatoes as cash crops, first tested in royal pastureland of longtoed and longmed, which had been converted to potato farms. beginning with the large-scale production in khaling and chapcha, potatoes become a key export crop, reaching 60,000 tonnes, grown by over 10,725 households by 2006. in southern bhutan, the focus was on growing citrus fruits. for example, in 1977, the king encouraged the people of dagana to start cardamom and orange plantations. both of these cash crops are now major sources of rural income as 3,400 tonnes of cardamom, 55,558 tonnes of oranges and 7,400 tonnes of apples were produced in 2006 due to the initiatives taken first in 1970s. socio-economic development a kasho (royal decree) issued by king jigme singye in 1986 directed the planning commission to ensure that \"the basis for the evaluation of the achievements of the sixth plan is to see whether the people enjoy happiness and comfort\". the social and economic indicators point towards sub-ordinate goals, not ultimate goals which was to be measured from a holistic, gnh point of view. happiness and contentment became the ultimate yardstick of progress. data, which enables comparison of achievements over time starting from 1985 onwards, some 14 years after the king\\'s ascension to the throne. there is a lack of systematic quantitative information about the social and economic situation of bhutan for the 1970s. the baselines for historical comparison available today were first collected in 1985 - the year when time series data was collected. some information that date back to 1974 indicate the low base of infrastructure that existed at that time. there were 11 ill-equipped hospitals, staffed mostly by foreign doctors, and 45 basic health units in 1974, the year jigme singye\\'s coronation was held. sparse networks of 1,332 km of roads had been built by 1974, compared to 4,544 by the end of his reign in 2006. in 1974, 24 wireless stations linked the rest of the country. telephone connections, mostly for officials in thimphu, were limited to 480 in 1974 compared to 31,526 in 2006. there were 13,410 students enrolled in schools compared to 151,260 or so in 2006. by 2006, school enrollment touched 90%, literacy 60%, and both were so mainly due to a free education policy (more information at education in bhutan and ministry of education website). health services, safe drinking water and better nutrition have led to a 66-year life-span and lower morbidity during this life span. one of the constraints in education and health was the lack of qualified people. in 1976, king jigme singye commanded the establishment of the royal institute of health sciences (rihs) and the first batch of health assistants and basic health workers passed out in 1986. there were 56 health establishments in 1974; by 2006 there were 715 resulting in 90% free primary health coverage. in 1985, there was nearly 50% health coverage. infant mortality has fallen from 142 in 1985, to 60 in 2006. this was mainly due to the success of universal child immunisation and the supply of safe drinking water. there were 150 water supply schemes in 1985; this increased to 3,852 by 2006, giving 78% coverage of safe drinking water. maternal mortality rate dropped from 7.7% in 1985 to 2.6% in 2006. besides these human development indicators, material prosperity rose remarkably. the distance between bhutan and the outside world shortened because of motor road and air services. wangchuck visited delhi in 1978 and during that visit he discussed the possibility of having air links with india to promote its trade and commerce. the discussion was fruitful and led to a donier flight between paro and kolkata in 1983. by 2006, air services connected bhutan to kathmandu, delhi, dhaka and bangkok. just four million units of electricity were generated in 1974, compared to 3.357 billion units by the end of his reign in 2006. in 1985, just around 10,000 households had electricity, and the number reached over 65,000 meter-point units by 2006. the connectivity of bhutan increased in his reign through air services, internet, and surface transport. internet reached bhutan in 1999. the spread of faxes, telephones, satellite tvs, computers, and the internet brought bhutan into a transnational or globalized world. the national income of the country, as measured by gdp, was nu 2.4 billion in 1985. this increased to nu 36.9 billion in 2006, which was a 15-fold increase in 21 years. bhutan\\'s per capita income reached us$1,500 in 2006 by the end of his reign. in purchasing power parity terms, bhutan\\'s per capita income in 2006 was nearly us$4,085. the king introduced an unconventional tourism policy of \"high-value, low-volume\". soon after the coronation, in october 1974, the first group of 20 tourists entered the country through phuntsholing, as there was no air service then. by 2006, the number of tourists, flown in by druk air and who paid royalty, reached 17,344. one of the landmark developments, soon after his coronation, was the signing of the chukha hydropower project in march 1974. construction began in 1983 and the president of india, ramaswamy venkataraman and king jigme singye inaugurated the chukha hydropower project on 21 october 1988, nearly 13 years after the first discussion on it took place, in 1974. chukha improved the revenue situation and the financial capacity of the country. in the industrial sphere, an early landmark project planned soon after his coronation was the development of a complete master plan for the construction of the penden cement factory. the actual construction started in 1979 and the company was in production by 1983. the penden cement authority produced about half a million tonnes of cement every day, for instance in 2008. manufacturing and mining spread, mostly in the southern towns. culture the country strived to preserve major local languages, knowledge, beliefs, customs, skills, trades and institutions, and even species of crops and plants. bhutanese society also remained cohesive because of promoting cultural identities under the fourth king\\'s reign. wangchuck emphasized the distinctive characters of bhutanese cultures. wangchuck stated that it is the \"distinct identity of our county\", and not the nation\\'s \"wealth, weapons and armed forces\", that is the vital instrument in securing the sovereignty of the nation. in the 34 years of wangchuck\\'s reign, the ten traditional cultural sciences (rignas) received considerable priority. wangchuck cherished the importance of both the intangible and tangible aspects of bhutanese culture. as an example of wangchuck\\'s support to classical bhutanese culture he had tango shedra built. tango shedra became the apex of education according to classical system of cultural sciences, rignas. academic monks complete their long studies with bachelor\\'s and master\\'s degrees in tango. in 2008, 163 candidates - with 14 master\\'s degrees and 149 bachelor\\'s degrees -from tango shedra and sangngag chokhor shedra in paro held their graduation ceremonies at tango. zo rigpa was enhanced by wangchuck when he opened the kawajangsa institution of zorig (now known as national institute for zorig chusum) in 1971. at first, this institute concentrated on traditional fine arts. a similar institution was opened in 1997 in tashi yangtse. the folk heritage museum started by her majesty ashi dorji wangmo wangchuck in kawajangsa, thimphu in 2001, drew attention to the heritage of lay people\\'s sustainable products and their lifestyle. likewise, in 2001, the first textile museum opened by her majesty ashi sangay choden wangchuck drew attention to the weaving skills of bhutan. skilled artisans - painters, statue-makers, carpenters and masons proliferated in wangchuck\\'s reign not only because of these new institutions, but also by receiving on the job training in many new temples and dzongs constructed in the country. the profile of indigenous medicine also became higher under wangchuck\\'s reign. indigenous medicine spread as a parallel health service due to support to institute of indigenous medicine. there probably were only about 2,000 monks in the state supported monasteries in 1972 when his reign started. by 2006, the number of monks subsisting on state allowances had increased to little over 6,000. in parallel to the increase in the number of monks and nuns, the monastic infrastructure that included tutors, lamas, temples, (meditation centres), and shedras (buddhist colleges), increased in wangchuck\\'s reign. many new official dratshangs in district headquarters, which hitherto did not have any monastic body, were opened such as tsirang, gaylegphug, tashi yangtse, samtse, pema gatshel, chukha, bumthang and zhemgang. numerous affiliate monasteries to each dzongkhag rabdey were also opened throughout the country. by 2006, there were 13 shedras located in tango, dodeydrag, khothokha, sanga choekhor, gontey, tshangkha, tharpaling, nimalung, talo nalanda, sewla, ngatsang, drametse, and bartsham with a total enrolment of some 700 monks. there were over 24 or meditation places, stretching from singye dzong in the east to tagchu goenpa in haa, enlisting 300 officially supported people who meditate on a long-term basis in 2006. these numbers were rolled as new meditation to succeed old ones upon their completion. there were over 45 monastic lobdras, where teachers received official stipends and where (young lay priests) studied. by 2006, there were also 10 nunneries, started on an organized basis, located in jashar goenpa in pema gatshel in the east to kila goenpa in paro in the west. environmental preservation wangchuck also enhanced the protection of natural resources such as forests and biodiversity. wangchuck foresaw the potentially adverse impacts of both increased economic activity and increased population on the fragility of the mountain ecosystem. he raised the importance of preservation of environment during policy discussions, which resulted in vast areas of the country being devoted to parks and sanctuaries. among events of his reign: jigme dorji national park, khaling wildlife sanctuary and phibsoo wildlife sanctuary declared in 1974 environmental studies started in schools, 1985 bhutan identified as a global hotspot, 1988 national environment commission established in 1990 bhutan trust fund for environment established in 1992 toorsa nature reserve, jigme singye wangchuck national park (known earlier as jow durshing national park), thrumsengla national park, sakteng wildlife sanctuary and bomdeling wildlife sanctuary established in 1993 un framework convention on climate change and convention on biological diversity signed in 1995 environment assessment act, 2000 bio-diversity act of bhutan, 2003 wangchuck and the people of bhutan received the \"champions of the earth\" award from unep, 2005 decentralisation at the end of the 4th fyp (1976-1981), wangchuck extensively reviewed the successes and challenges of the previous four years of development, which also included the physical inspection of the field projects. wangchuck envisioned different planning system for the 5th fyp (1981-86) emphasising decentralisation. new dzongdags were appointed in all the 18 districts, with responsibilities of managing public finances and co-ordinating district development plans, in their capacities as chairmen of dyts. dzongdags were delegated broad powers to make decisions at the local level in conjunction with gups and . wangchuck\\'s strengthening of the governmental sectors went hand in hand with strengthening local bodies like dzongkhag yargye tshogchung (dyt) that wangchuck founded in 1981, and the gewog yargye tshogchung (gyt) he founded in 1991. he increasingly devolved authority on them. wangchuck\\'s state visits abroad bhutanese participation in international organisations at various levels increased. personally, wangchuck attended the non-aligned and saarc summits until 1997, travelling to colombo in 1976 for 8th non-aligned summit; havana in 1979 for 6th non-aligned summit; new delhi in 1983 for 5th saarc summit and 1995 for 8th saarc summit; harare in 1986 for 8th non-aligned summit; kathmandu in 1987 for 3rd saarc summit; islamabad in 1988 for 4th saarc summit; belgrade in 1989 for 9th non-aligned summit; malé in 1990 for 5th saarc summit, and dhaka in 1993 for 7th saarc summit. diplomatic expansion wangchuck emphasised a two-fold foreign policy for bhutan: to deepen bhutan\\'s relations with india and to create new bonds of friendship with fellow members of the un. to diversify the sources of funding, bhutan cultivated close relationships with the un, ever since the visit of a un under-secretary general in 1974. relationships with other nations widened rapidly after 1974. the coronation of 1974 brought a large numbers of foreign delegates. representatives of some 18 nations attended the coronation. notably, a representative from china also attended. bhutan had supported china\\'s seat in the united nations in 1971 soon after bhutan became a member of the un. in parallel to the increase in development assistance, the decade between 1980 and 1990 was a period of enhanced diplomacy for bhutan. in this decade, under the guidance of wangchuck, bhutan established diplomatic relations with 17 out of the existing 53 countries, and became associated with 12 out of 20 organisations of the united nations family. in wangchuck\\'s reign, diplomatic links were developed with many other nations such as bangladesh in 1973; kuwait in 1983; nepal in 1983; the maldives in 1984; denmark in 1985; norway in 1985; sweden in 1985; switzerland in 1985; netherlands in 1985; japan in 1986; finland in 1986; south korea in 1987; sri lanka in 1987; austria in 1989; thailand in 1991; bahrain in 1992; singapore in 2002; australia in 2002 and canada in 2003. wangchuck cultivated bonds of friendship with other countries and strengthened bhutan-international relationships and diversified its sources of development assistance. jubilee and abdication the silver jubilee of jigme singye wangchuck was celebrated in 1999 to mark 25 years since his coronation. a commemorative medal was also issued to mark the occasion. wangchuck said after announcing his decision to abdicate in 2006 \"in taking note of the progress that our nation has

       " 'an elegy is a poem of serious reflection, and in english literature usually a lament for the dead. however, according to the oxford handbook of the elegy, \"for all of its pervasiveness ... the \\'elegy\\' remains remarkably ill defined: sometimes used as a catch-all to denominate texts of a somber or pessimistic tone, sometimes as a marker for textual monumentalizing, and sometimes strictly as a sign of a lament for the dead\". history the greek term ἐλεγείᾱ (elegeíā; from , , ‘lament\\') originally referred to any verse written in elegiac couplets and covering a wide range of subject matter (death, love, war). the term also included epitaphs, sad and mournful songs, and commemorative verses. the latin elegy of ancient roman literature was most often erotic or mythological in nature. because of its structural potential for rhetorical effects, the elegiac couplet was also used by both greek and roman poets for witty, humorous, and satirical subject matter. other than epitaphs, examples of ancient elegy as a poem of mourning include catullus\\' carmen 101, on his dead brother, and elegies by propertius on his dead mistress cynthia and a matriarch of the prominent cornelian family. ovid wrote elegies bemoaning his exile, which he likened to a death. literature english in english literature, the more modern and restricted meaning, of a lament for a departed beloved or tragic event, has been current only since the sixteenth century; the broader concept was still employed by john donne for his elegies written in the early seventeenth century. that looser concept is especially evident in the old english exeter book (circa 1000 ce), which contains \"serious meditative\" and well-known poems such as \"the wanderer\", \"the seafarer\", and \"the wife\\'s lament\". in those elegies, the narrators use the lyrical \"i\" to describe their own personal and mournful experiences. they tell the story of the individual rather than the collective lore of his or her people as epic poetry seeks to tell. by the time of samuel taylor coleridge and others, the term had come to mean \"serious meditative poem\": a famous example of elegy is thomas gray\\'s elegy written in a country churchyard (1750). other languages in french, perhaps the most famous elegy is le lac (1820) by alphonse de lamartine. in germany, the most famous example is duino elegies by rainer maria rilke (1922). in the islamic world—namely shia islam, the most famous examples are elegies written by sachay bhai on the battle of karbala. elegies written on husayn ibn ali and his followers are very common and produced even today. in spain, one of the capital works in spanish is coplas por la muerte de su padre (stanzas about the death of his father), written between 1460 and 1470 by jorge manrique. music \"elegy\" (french: élégie) may denote a type of musical work, usually of a sad or somber nature. a well-known example is the élégie, op. 10, by jules massenet. this was originally written for piano, as a student work; then he set it as a song; and finally it appeared as the \"invocation\", for cello and orchestra, a section of his incidental music to leconte de lisle\\'s les érinnyes. other examples include the elegy op. 58 of edward elgar and the elegy for strings of benjamin britten. though not specifically designated an elegy, samuel barber\\'s adagio for strings has an elegiac character. see also references further reading external links genres of poetry poetic forms laments',\n",

       " 'the polish-muscovite war of 1605-1618, also known as the polish-muscovite war or the dimitriads, was a conflict fought between the tsardom of russia and the polish-lithuanian commonwealth together with zaporozhian cossacks from 1605 to 1618. russia had been experiencing the time of troubles since the death of tsar feodor i in 1598, causing political instability and a violent succession crisis upon the extinction of the rurik dynasty, and was ravaged by the major famine from 1601 to 1603. poland exploited russia\\'s civil wars when powerful members of the polish szlachta began influencing russian boyars and supporting false dmitris for the title of tsar of russia against the crowned boris godunov and vasili iv shuysky. in 1605, polish nobles conducted a series of skirmishes until the death of false dmitry i in 1606, and invaded again in 1607 until russia formed a military alliance with sweden two years later. polish king sigismund declared war on russia in response in 1609, aiming to gain territorial concessions and weaken sweden\\'s ally, winning many early victories such as the battle of klushino. in 1610, polish forces entered moscow and sweden withdrew from the military alliance with russia, instead triggering the ingrian war. sigismund\\'s son, the prince władysław of poland, was elected tsar by the seven boyars in september 1610, but sigismund refused to allow his son to become the new tsar unless the muscovites agreed to convert to catholicism, with the pro-polish boyars ending their support for the polish-lithuanian commonwealth. in 1611, kuzma minin and prince dmitry pozharsky formed a new army to launch a popular revolt against the polish occupation. the poles captured smolensk in june 1611 but began to retreat after they were ousted from moscow in september 1612. michael romanov, the son of patriarch filaret of moscow, was elected tsar of russia in 1613, beginning the romanov dynasty and ending the time of troubles. with little military action between 1612 and 1617, the war finally ended in 1618 with the truce of deulino, which granted the polish-lithuanian commonwealth certain territorial concessions but preserved russia\\'s independence. the war was the first major sign of the rivalry and uneasy relations between poland and russia which last to this day. its aftermath had a long-lasting impact on russian society, creating the negative stereotype of poland in russia and, most notably, giving rise to the romanov dynasty which ruled russia for three centuries until the february revolution in 1917. it also left a noticeable mark on russian culture, with renowned writers and composers portraying the war in works such as boris godunov (play) by alexander pushkin (adapted into an opera by modest mussorgsky), a life for the tsar by mikhail glinka, pan voyevoda by nikolai rimsky-korsakov as well as films minin and pozharsky and 1612. names of the war the conflict is often referred to by different names, most commonly the russo-polish war, with the term russia replacing the term muscovy. in polish historiography, the wars are usually referred to as the dimitriads: the first dymitriad (1605-1606) and second dymitriad (1607-1609) and the polish-muscovite war (1609-1618), which can subsequently be divided into two wars of 1609-1611 and 1617-1618, and may or may not include the 1617-1618 campaign, which is sometimes referred to as chodkiewicz [muscovite] campaign. according to russian historiography, the chaotic events of the war fall into the \"time of troubles\". the conflict with poles is commonly called the polish invasion, polish intervention, or more specifically the polish intervention of the early seventeenth century. prelude to the war in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, russia was in a state of political and economic crisis. after the death of tsar ivan iv (\"the terrible\") in 1584, and the death of his son dimitri in 1591, several factions competed for the tsar\\'s throne. in 1598, boris godunov was crowned to the russian throne, marking the end of the centuries long rule of the rurik dynasty. while his policies were rather moderate and well-intentioned, his rule was marred by the general perception of its questionable legitimacy and allegations of his involvement in orchestrating the assassination of dimitri. while godunov managed to put the opposition to his rule under control, he did not manage to crush it completely. to add to his troubles, the first years of the 17th century were exceptionally cold. the drop in temperature was felt all over the world and was most likely caused by a severe eruption of a volcano in south america. in russia, it resulted in a great famine that swept through the country from 1601 to 1603. in late 1600, a polish diplomatic mission led by chancellor lew sapieha with eliasz pielgrzymowski and stanisław warszycki arrived in moscow and proposed an alliance between the commonwealth and russia, which would include a future personal union. they proposed that after one monarch\\'s death without heirs, the other would become the ruler of both countries. however, tsar godunov declined the union proposal and settled on extending the treaty of jam zapolski, which ended the lithuanian wars of the 16th century, by 22 years (to 1622). sigismund and the commonwealth magnates knew full well that they were not capable of any serious invasion of russia; the commonwealth army was too small, its treasury always empty, and the war lacked popular support. however, as the situation in russia deteriorated, sigismund and many commonwealth magnates, especially those with estates and forces near the russian border, began to look for a way to profit from the chaos and weakness of their eastern neighbour. this proved easy, as in the meantime many russian boyars, disgruntled by the ongoing civil war, tried to entice various neighbors, including the polish-lithuanian commonwealth, into intervening. some of them looked to their own profits, trying to organize support for their own ascension to the russian throne. others looked to their western neighbor, the commonwealth, and its attractive golden freedoms, and together with some polish politicians planned for some kind of union between those two states. yet others tried to tie their fates with that of sweden in what became known as the de la gardie campaign and the ingrian war. advocates for a union of poland-lithuania with russia proposed a plan similar to the original polish-lithuanian union of lublin involving a common foreign policy and military; the right for nobility to choose the place where they would live and to buy landed estates; removal of barriers for trade and transit; introduction of a single currency; increased religious tolerance in russia (especially the right to build churches of non-orthodox faiths); and the sending of boyar children for education in more developed polish academies (like the jagiellonian university). however, this project never gained much support. many boyars feared that the union with the predominantly catholic kingdom of poland and the grand duchy of lithuania would endanger russia\\'s orthodox traditions and opposed anything that threatened russian culture, especially the policies aimed at curtailing the influence of the orthodox church, intermarriage and education in polish schools that had already led to successful polonization of the ruthenian lands under polish control. the polish invasion (1605-1606) for most of the 17th century, sigismund iii was occupied with internal problems of his own, like the nobles\\' rebellion in the commonwealth and the wars with sweden and in moldavia. however, the impostor false dmitry i appeared in poland in 1603 and soon found enough support among powerful magnates such as michał wiśniowiecki, lew, and jan piotr sapieha, who provided him with funds for a campaign against godunov. commonwealth magnates looked forward to material gains from the campaign and control over russia through false dmitriy. in addition, both polish magnates and russian boyars advanced plans for a union between the commonwealth and russia, similar to the one lew sapieha had discussed in 1600 (when the idea had been dismissed by godunov). finally, the proponents of catholicism saw in dmitry a tool to spread the influence of their church eastwards, and after promises of a united catholic dominated russo-polish entity waging a war on the ottoman empire, jesuits also provided him with funds and education. although sigismund declined to support dmitry officially with the full might of the commonwealth, the polish king was always happy to support pro-catholic initiatives and provided him with the sum of 4,000 zlotys-enough for a few hundred soldiers. nonetheless, some of dmitriy\\'s supporters, especially among those involved in the rebellion, actively worked to have dmitry replace sigismund. in exchange, in june 1604 dmitry promised the commonwealth \"half of smolensk territory\". many were skeptical about the future of this endeavor. jan zamoyski, opposed to most of sigismund\\'s policies, later referred to the entire false dmitry i affair as a \"comedy worthy of plautus or terentius\". when boris godunov heard about the pretender, he claimed that the man was just a runaway monk called grigory otrepyev, although on what information he based this claim is unclear. godunov\\'s support among the russians began to wane, especially when he tried to spread counter-rumors. some of the russian boyars also claimed to accept dmitry as such support gave them legitimate reasons not to pay taxes to godunov. dmitry attracted a number of followers, formed a small army, and, supported by approximately 3500 soldiers of the commonwealth magnates\\' private armies and the mercenaries bought by dmitriy\\'s own cash, rode to russia in june 1604. some of godunov\\'s other enemies, including approximately 2,000 southern cossacks, joined dimitry\\'s forces on his way to moscow. dmitriy\\'s forces fought two engagements with reluctant russian soldiers; his army won the first at novhorod-siverskyi, soon capturing chernigov, putivl, sevsk, and kursk, but badly lost the second battle of dobrynichi and nearly disintegrated. dmitry\\'s cause was only saved by the news of the death of tsar boris godunov. the sudden death of the tsar on 13 april 1605 removed the main barrier to further advances by dimitry. russian troops began to defect to his side, and, on 1 june, boyars in moscow imprisoned the newly crowned tsar, boris\\'s son feodor ii, and the boy\\'s mother, later brutally murdering them. on 20 june the impostor made his triumphal entry into moscow, and on 21 july he was crowned tsar by a new patriarch of his own choosing, the greek cypriot patriarch ignatius, who as bishop of ryazan had been the first church leader to recognize dmitry as tsar. the alliance with poland was furthered by dimitriy\\'s marriage (per procura in kraków) with the daughter of jerzy mniszech, marina mniszech, a polish noblewoman with whom dmitry had fallen in love while in poland. the new tsarina outraged many russians by refusing to convert from catholicism to the russian orthodox faith. commonwealth king sigismund was a prominent guest at this wedding. marina soon left to join her husband in moscow, where she was crowned a tsarina in may. while dmitry\\'s rule itself was nondescript and devoid of significant blunders, his position was weak. many boyars felt they could gain more influence, even the throne, for themselves, and many were still wary of polish cultural influence, especially in view of dmitriy\\'s court being increasingly dominated by the aliens he brought with himself from poland. the golden freedoms, declaring all nobility equal, that were supported by lesser nobility, threatened the most powerful of the boyars. thus the boyars, headed by prince vasily shuyski, began to plot against dmitry and his pro-polish faction, accusing him of homosexuality, spreading roman catholicism and polish customs, and selling russia to jesuits and the pope. they gained popular support, especially as dmitry was visibly supported by a few hundred irregular commonwealth forces, which still garrisoned moscow, and often engaged in various criminal acts, angering the local population. on the morning of 17 may 1606, about two weeks after the marriage, conspirators stormed the kremlin. dmitry tried to flee through a window but broke his leg in the fall. one of the plotters shot him dead on the spot. at first, the body was put on display, but it was later cremated; the ashes were reportedly shot from a cannon toward poland. dmitriy\\'s reign had lasted a mere ten months. vasili shuyski took his place as tsar. about five hundred of dmitriy\\'s commonwealth supporters were killed, imprisoned, or forced to leave russia. the second polish invasion (1607-1609) tsar vasili shuyski was unpopular and weak in russia and his reign was far from stable. he was perceived as anti-polish; he had led the coup against the first false dmitry, killing over 500 polish soldiers in moscow and imprisoning a polish envoy. the civil war raged on, as in 1607 the false dmitry ii appeared, again supported by some polish magnates and \\'recognized\\' by marina mniszech as her first husband. this brought him the support of the magnates of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth who had supported false dmitry i before. adam wiśniowiecki, roman różyński, jan piotr sapieha decided to support the second pretender as well, supplying him with some early funds and about 7,500 soldiers. the pillaging of his army, especially of the lisowczycy mercenaries led by aleksander lisowski, contributed to the placard in sergiyev posad: \"three plagues: typhus, tatars and poles\". in 1608 together with aleksander kleczkowski, lisowczycy, leading a few hundred don cossacks working for the commonwealth, ragtag szlachta and mercenaries, defeated the army of tsar vasili shuyski led by zakhary lyapunov and ivan khovansky at the battle of zaraysk and captured mikhailov and kolomna. then lisowczycy advanced towards moscow but was defeated by vasiliy buturlin at the battle of medvezhiy brod, losing most of his plunder. when polish commander jan piotr sapieha failed to win the siege of troitse-sergiyeva lavra, lisowczycy retreated to the vicinity of rakhmantsevo. soon, however, came successes (pillages) at kostroma, soligalich, and some other cities. dmitry speedily captured karachev, bryansk, and other towns. he was reinforced by the poles, and in the spring of 1608 advanced upon moscow, routing the army of tsar vasily shuyski at bolkhov. dmitry\\'s promises of the wholesale confiscation of the estates of the boyars drew many common people to his side. the village of tushino, about twelve kilometers from the capital, was converted into an armed camp, where dmitry gathered his army. his forces initially included 7,000 polish soldiers, 10,000 cossacks, and 10,000 other soldiers, including former members of the failed rokosz of zebrzydowski, but his force grew gradually in power, and soon exceeded 100,000 men. he raised another illustrious captive, feodor romanov, to the rank of patriarch, enthroning him as patriarch filaret, and won the allegiance of the cities of yaroslavl, kostroma, vologda, kashin, and several others. however, his fortunes were soon to reverse, as the commonwealth decided to take a more active stance in the russian civil wars. polish-muscovite war (1609-1618) polish victories (1609-1610) in 1609 the zebrzydowski rebellion ended when tsar vasili signed a military alliance with charles ix of sweden (on 28 february 1609). the commonwealth king sigismund iii, whose primary goal was to regain the swedish throne, got permission from the polish sejm (parliament) to declare war on russia. he viewed it as an excellent opportunity to expand the commonwealth\\'s territory and sphere of influence, with hopes that the eventual outcome of the war would catholicize orthodox russia (in this he was strongly supported by the pope) and enable him to defeat sweden. this plan also allowed him to give a purpose to the numerous restless former supporters of zebrzydowski, luring them with promises of wealth and fame awaiting members of the campaign beyond the commonwealth\\'s eastern border. a book published that year by the well-travelled polish silesian nobleman, courtier and political activist paweł palczowski of palczowic, kolęda moskiewska (the muscovite carol), compared russia to the indian empires of the new world, full of golden cities and easy to conquer. the treatise was written to promote polish colonialism and persuade delegates of the sejm in january 1609 to support sigismund iii\\'s expedition to muscovy. palczowski himself participated in and perished during sigismund\\'s muscovy expedition. some russian boyars assured sigismund of their support by offering the throne to his son, prince władysław. previously, sigismund had been unwilling to commit the majority of polish forces or his time to the internal conflict in russia, but in 1609 those factors made him re-evaluate and drastically change his policy. although many polish nobles and soldiers were fighting for the second false dmitry at the time, sigismund iii and the troops under his command did not support dimitriy for the throne - sigismund wanted russia himself. the entry of sigismund into russia caused the majority of the polish supporters of false dmitry ii to desert him and contributed to his defeat. a series of subsequent disasters induced false dmitry ii to flee his camp disguised as a peasant and to go to kostroma together with marina. dmitry made another unsuccessful attack on moscow, and, supported by the don cossacks, recovered a hold over all of south-eastern russia. he was killed, however, while half drunk, on 11 december 1610 by a qasim tatar princeling pyotr urusov, whom dimitriy had flogged on a previous occasion. a commonwealth army under the command of hetman stanisław żółkiewski, who was generally opposed to this conflict but could not disobey the king\\'s orders, crossed the border and on 29 september 1609 laid siege to smolensk, an important city russia had captured from lithuania in 1514. smolensk was manned by fewer than 1,000 russian men commanded by the voivod mikhail shein, while żółkiewski commanded 12,000 troops. however, smolensk had one major advantage: the previous tsar, boris godunov, had sponsored the fortification of the city with a massive fortress completed in 1602. the poles found it impenetrable; they settled into a long siege, firing artillery into the city, attempting to tunnel under the moat, and building earthen ramparts, remnants of which can still be seen today. the siege lasted 20 months before the poles with the help of a russian defector named andrei dedishin eventually succeeded in taking the fortress. not all of the commonwealth attacks were successful. an early attack, led by hetman jan karol chodkiewicz with 2,000 men, ended in defeat when the unpaid commonwealth army mutinied and compelled their leader to retreat through the heart of russia and back to smolensk. not until crown prince władysław, arrived with tardy reinforcements did the war assume a different character. in the meantime, lisowczycy took and plundered pskov in 1610 and clashed with the swedes operating in russia during the ingrian war. several different visions of the campaign and political goals clashed in the polish camp. some of the former members of the zebrzydowski rebellion, opponents of sigismund, actually advanced proposals to have sigismund dethroned and dmitriy, or even shuyski, elected king. żółkiewski, who from the beginning opposed the invasion of russia, came into conflict with sigismund over the scope, methods, and goal of the campaign. żółkiewski represented the traditional views of polish nobility, the szlachta, which did not support waging aggressive and dangerous wars against a strong enemy like russia. thus żółkiewski favored the plans for peaceful and voluntary union, much like that with lithuania. żółkiewski offered russian boyars rights and religious freedom, envisioning an association resulting in the creation of the polish-lithuanian-muscovite commonwealth. to that end, he felt that moscow\\'s cooperation should be gained via diplomacy, not force. sigismund iii, however, did not want to engage in political deals and compromises, especially when these had to include concessions to the orthodox church. sigismund was a vocal, almost fanatical, supporter of the catholic church and counter-reformation, and believed that he could win everything and take moscow by force, and then establish his own rule along with the rule of roman catholicism. poles in moscow (1610) on 31 january 1610 sigismund received a delegation of boyars opposed to shuyski, who asked władysław to become the tsar. on 24 february sigismund sent them a letter in which he agreed to do so, but only when moscow was at peace. hetman żółkiewski, whose only other choice was mutiny, decided to follow the king\\'s orders and left smolensk in 1610, leaving only a smaller force necessary to continue the siege. with cossack reinforcements, he marched on moscow. however, as he feared and predicted, as the polish-lithuanian forces pressed eastwards, ravaging russian lands, and as sigismund\\'s lack of willingness to compromise became more and more apparent, many supporters of the poles and of the second false dmitry left the pro-polish camp and turned to shuyski\\'s anti-polish faction. russian forces under grigory voluyev were coming to relieve smolensk and fortified the fort at tsaryovo-zaymishche (carowo, cariewo, tsarovo-zajmiszcze) to bar the poles\\' advance on moscow. the siege of tsaryovo began on 24 june. however, the russians were not prepared for a long siege and had little food and water inside the fort. voluyev sent word for dmitry shuyski (tsar shuyski\\'s brother) to come to their aid and lift the siege. shuyski\\'s troops marched for tsaryovo, not by the direct route, but round-about through klushino, hoping to come to tsaryovo by the back route. shuyski received aid from swedish forces under the command of jacob pontusson de la gardie. żółkiewski learned of shuyski\\'s relief force and divided his troops to meet the russians before they could come to tsaryovo and lift the siege. he left at night so that voluyev would not notice his absence. the combined russian and swedish armies were defeated on 4 july 1610 at the battle of klushino (kłuszyn), where 7,000 polish elite cavalry, the winged hussars, led by the hetman himself, defeated the numerically superior russian army of about 35,000-40,000 soldiers. this giant and surprising defeat of the russians shocked everyone and opened a new phase in the conflict. after the news of klushino spread, support for tsar shuyski almost completely evaporated. żółkiewski soon convinced the russian units at tsaryovo, which were much stronger than the ones at kłuszyn, to capitulate and to swear an oath of loyalty to władysław. then he incorporated them into his army and moved towards moscow. in august 1610 many russian boyars accepted that sigismund iii was victorious and that władysław would become the next tsar if he converted to eastern orthodoxy. the russian duma voted for tsar shuyski to be removed from the throne. shuyski\\'s family, including the tsar, were captured, and shuyski was reportedly taken to a monastery, forcibly shaved as a monk, and compelled to remain at the monastery under guard. he was later sent to warsaw, as a kind of war trophy, and eventually died in gostynin. shortly after shuyski was removed, both żółkiewski and the second false dmitri arrived at moscow with their separate armies. it was a tense moment, filled with the confusion of the conflict. various pro- and anti-polish, swedish, and domestic boyar factions vied for temporary control of the situation. the russian army and the people themselves were unsure if this was an invasion and that they should close and defend the city, or if it was a liberating force that should be allowed in and welcomed as allies. after a few skirmishes, the pro-polish faction gained dominance, and the poles were allowed into moscow on 8 october. the boyars opened moscow\\'s gates to the polish troops and asked żółkiewski to protect them from anarchy. the moscow kremlin was then garrisoned by polish troops commanded by aleksander gosiewski. on 27 july a treaty was signed between the boyars and żółkiewski promising the russian boyars the same vast privileges the polish szlachta had, in exchange for them recognizing władysław as the new tsar. however, żółkiewski did not know that sigismund, who remained at smolensk, already had other plans. in the meantime, żółkiewski and the second false dmitriy, formerly reluctant allies, began to part ways. the second false dmitry had lost much of his influence over the polish court, and żółkiewski would eventually try to drive dmitry from the capital. żółkiewski soon began manoeuvring for a tsar of polish origin, particularly the 15-year-old prince władysław. the boyars had offered the throne to władysław at least twice, in the hopes of having the liberal polish-lithuanian commonwealth end the despotic rule of their current tsars. through żółkiewski\\'s work, the pro-polish factions among the boyars (composed of knyazes fyodor mstislavsky, vasily galitzine, fyodor sheremetev, daniil mezetsky and diaks vasily telepnyov, and tomiło łagowski) gained dominance and once again a majority of the boyars said that they would support władysław for the throne, if he converted to orthodoxy and if the polish-lithuanian commonwealth returned the fortresses that they had captured in the war. however, sigismund, supported by some of the more devout and zealous nobility, was completely opposed to the conversion of the prince. from that point the planned polish-lithuanian-muscovite union began to fall apart. offended and angered by sigismund, the boyars dragged their feet on supporting władysław. they were divided between electing vasily galitzine, michael romanov (also 15 years old), or the second false dmitriy. żółkiewski acted quickly, making promises without the consent of the still-absent king, and the boyars elected władysław as the new tsar. żółkiewski had the most prominent of the opponents, fyodor romanov, michael\\'s father and the patriarch of moscow, exiled from russia in order to secure polish support. after the election of władysław, the second false dmitry fled from tushino, a city near moscow, to his base at kaluga. however, his position was precarious even there, and he was killed on 20 december by one of his own men. marina mniszech, though, was pregnant with the new \"heir\" to the russian throne, ivan dmitriyevich, and she would still be a factor in russian politics until her eventual death in 1614. władysław faced further opposition from a seemingly unlikely party: his father. when żółkiewski returned to meet sigismund at smolensk in november of that year, sigismund iii changed his mind and decided that he could gain the russian throne for himself. a majority of the russians opposed the move, especially as sigismund didn\\'t hide his intent to catholicize and polonize the russian tsardom. żółkiewski found himself in an awkward position - he had promised the boyars prince władysław to keep the russian throne for poland, and he knew that they would not accept sigismund iii, who was unpopular throughout russia. however, he also had to explain this to his king, who was convinced, from his conquests in the west, of his popularity in russia. eventually, żółkiewski, disappointed with sigismund, returned to poland. sigismund eventually compromised and decided that he would allow his son to take the throne and that he would rule as regent until władysław came of age. thus, he required that the boyars who submitted and swore allegiance to prince władysław would also have to swear an oath to him. the boyars were more resistant to this request and support for the poles eroded fast. władysław was never able to take real power, and the war soon resumed. sigismund and władysław left the city for safer ground as tensions grew, and the small polish garrison at the kremlin soon became isolated and subject to increased hostility, as more and more of the formerly pro-polish boyars began to change factions. the polish forces outside moscow under the command of jan piotr sapieha clashed with the growing anti-polish russian forces of the so-called first volunteer army, led by prokopy lyapunov. in the meantime, the siege of smolensk continued, even as władysław was named tsar of russia and cities and forts throughout the area swore allegiance to the poles. however, sigismund iii required that smolensk not only swear allegiance, but open its gates to the poles, which the russians refused to do. żółkiewski fortified moscow with his army and returned to king sigismund iii, who had remained at smolensk while żółkiewski negotiated in moscow. the largest tunneling project at smolensk came in december 1610; however, the poles only managed to destroy more of the outer wall - the inner wall remained intact. the siege continued. at one point, the polish guns breached the outer wall, and the governor of braclaw (bracław) ordered his soldiers to rush in; however, the russians had predicted where the breach would occur and had fortified that part of the wall with additional men. both sets of troops were slaughtered, and the poles were eventually beaten back. the war resumes (1611) a 1611 uprising in moscow against the polish garrison marked the end of russian tolerance for the commonwealth intervention. the citizens of moscow had voluntarily participated in the coup in 1606, killing 500 polish soldiers. now, ruled by the poles, they once again revolted. the moscow burghers took over the munition store, but polish troops defeated the first wave of attackers, and the fighting resulted in a large fire that consumed part of moscow. from july onward the situation of the commonwealth forces became grave, as the uprising turned into a siege of the polish-held kremlin. reportedly, the poles had imprisoned the leader of the orthodox church, patriarch hermogenes. when the russians attacked moscow, the poles ordered him, as the man with the most authority with the russians at the time, to sign a statement to call off the attack. hermogenes refused and was starved to death. the polish kremlin garrison then found itself besieged. in the meantime, in late 1611, prince dmitry pozharsky was asked to lead the public opposition against the poles, organized by the merchants\\' guild of nizhny novgorod. the respected town butcher (literally, a meat-trader) kuzma minin oversaw the handling of funds donated by the merchants to form the second volunteer army (). when part of the polish army mutinied in january 1612 due to unpaid wages and retreated from russia towards the commonwealth, the forces of the second volunteer army strengthened the other anti-polish russian forces in moscow. the 9,000-strong polish army under hetman jan karol chodkiewicz attempted to lift the siege and clashed with russian forces, attempting to break through to polish forces in the kremlin on 1 september. the polish forces used cavalry attacks in the open field, exercising tactics that were new to them: escorting a mobile tabor fortress through the city. after early polish successes, the russian cossack reinforcements had forced chodkiewicz\\'s forces to retreat from moscow. russian reinforcements under prince pozharsky eventually starved the commonwealth garrison (there were reports of cannibalism) and forced its surrender on 1 november (though some sources give 6 november or 7 november) after the 19-month siege. a historian (parker) writes vividly of the polish soldiers: \"first they ate grass and offal, then they ate each other, and the survivors finally surrendered. the moscow kremlin fell on 6 november 1612.\" on 7 november, the polish soldiers withdrew from moscow. although the commonwealth negotiated a safe passage, the russian forces massacred half of the former kremlin garrison forces as they left the fortress. thus, the russian army recaptured moscow. on 2 june 1611 smolensk had finally fallen to the poles. after enduring 20 months of siege, two harsh winters and dwindling food supplies, the russians in smolensk finally reached their limit as the polish-lithuanian troops broke through the city gates. the polish army, advised by the runaway traitor andrei dedishin, discovered a weakness in the fortress defenses, and on 13 june 1611 cavalier of malta bartłomiej nowodworski inserted a mine into a sewer canal. the explosion created a large breach in the fortress walls. the fortress fell on the same day. the remaining 3,000 russian defenders took refuge in the assumption cathedral and blew themselves up with stores of gunpowder to avoid death at the hands of the invaders. although it was a blow to lose smolensk, the defeat freed up russian troops to fight the commonwealth in moscow, and the russian commander at smolensk, mikhail borisovich shein, was considered a hero for holding out as long as he had. he was captured at smolensk and remained a prisoner of poland-lithuania for the next nine years. a new respite (1612-1617) after the fall of smolensk, the russo-polish border remained relatively quiet for the next few years. however, no official treaty was signed. sigismund, criticized by the sejm (the polish parliament made up of the szlachta, who were always reluctant to levy taxes upon themselves to pay for any military force) for his failure to keep moscow, received little funding for the army. this led to a mutiny of the polish regular army (wojsko kwarciane), or rather to the specific semi-legal form of mutiny practiced in the commonwealth: a konfederacja (confederatio). the resulting konfederacja rohaczewska was considered the largest and most vicious of the soldiers\\' konfederacjas in the history of the commonwealth, and it pillaged commonwealth territories from 1612 until the most rebellious of the konfederacjas were defeated on 17 may 1614 at the battle of rohatyn, whereupon the rest received their wages. the leader of the konfederacja, jan karwacki, was captured and sent in chains by the future hetman stanisław koniecpolski to his mentor, hetman żółkiewski, and later executed in lwów. the ottoman empire further criticized sigismund because the cossacks in ukraine once again had begun to make unsanctioned raids into turkish territory. thus, poland-lithuania got no support from the ottoman empire in its war. in the meantime, the russian time of troubles was far from over, and russia had no strength to take advantage of the commonwealth\\'s weakness. on 21 february 1613 the zemsky sobor (\"assembly of the land\") named michael romanov, the now 16-year-old son of fyodor romanov, the new tsar. fyodor, now installed as patriarch filaret, was a popular boyar and patriarch of moscow, one of several boyars who vied to gain control of the russian throne during the time of troubles. the romanovs were a powerful boyar family; michael\\'s great-aunt (the sister of his grandfather) was anastasia romanovna, the wife of ivan the terrible. however, the new tsar had many opponents. marina mniszech tried until her death in 1614 to install her child as tsar of russia; various boyar factions still vied for power, trying to unseat the young tsar michael; and sweden intervened in force, trying to gain the throne for duke carl philip, even succeeding for a few months. however, philip received even less support than władysław, and the swedes were soon forced to retreat from russia. while both countries were shaken by internal strife, many smaller factions thrived. polish lisowczycy mercenaries, who were essential in the defense of smolensk in 1612, when most regulars (wojsko kwarciane) mutinied and joined the konfederacja rohatynska, were content to guard the polish border against the russian incursions for the next three years. however, in 1615 aleksander józef lisowski gathered many outlaws and invaded russia with 6 chorągiew of cavalry. he besieged bryansk and defeated the relief force of a few thousand soldiers under prince yuri shakhovskoy near karachev. then lisowski defeated the front guard of a force several times larger than his own, under the command of knyaz dmitry pozharsky, who decided to defend instead of attack and fortified his forces in a camp. lisowczycy broke contact with his forces, burned belyov and likhvin, took peremyshl, turned north, defeated the russian army at rzhev, proceeded north towards kashin, burned torzhok, and returned to poland heavy with loot without any further opposition from russian forces. lisowski and his forces remained at the russo-polish border until autumn 1616, at which point lisowski suddenly fell ill and died on 11 october. the formation was then known as lisowczycy. despite the death of lisowski, his forces remained a significant threat: in 1616 they captured kursk and defeated russian forces at bolkhov. the final stage (1617-1618) eventually the commonwealth sejm voted to raise the funds necessary to resume large scale military operations. the final attempt by sigismund and władysław to gain the throne was a new campaign launched on 6 april 1617. władysław was the nominal commander, but it was hetman chodkiewicz who had actual control over the army. in october, the towns of dorogobuzh (дорогобуж, drohobuż, drohobycz) and vyazma (вязьма, wiaźma) surrendered quickly, recognizing władysław as the tsar. however, the commonwealth forces met stubborn resistance near mozhaisk, and chodkiewicz\\'s plans for a quick advance to moscow failed. władysław did not have enough forces to advance to moscow again, especially because the russian support for the poles was all but gone by that time. in 1618 petro sahaidachny agreed to join the campaign against the tsardom of russia. his army of zaporozhian cossacks invaded from the south, captured and sacked a number of towns, such as livny, yelets, dankov, etc. and headed for moscow. the russian army opposing the poles retreated to moscow and on 2 october chodkiewicz and sahaidachny together launched a siege of the russian capital. however, their armies were not ready for a long siege and shortly after the night assault on october 10-11 failed, the siege was lifted. negotiations began and a peace treaty was signed in december 1618. aftermath in the end, sigismund did not succeed in becoming tsar or in securing the throne for władysław, but he was able to expand the commonwealth\\'s territory. during his reign poland-lithuania was the largest and most populous country in europe. on 11 december 1618 the truce of deulino, which concluded the dimitriad\\'s war, gave the commonwealth control over some of the conquered territories, including the territories of chernigov and severia (siewiersk) and the city of smolensk, and proclaimed a 15-year truce. władysław refused to relinquish his claim to the russian throne, even though sigismund had already done so. while the commonwealth gained some territories in the east, in terms of finance and lives it was a very costly victory. in 1632 the truce of deulino expired, and hostilities immediately resumed in the course of a conflict known as the smolensk war. this time the war was started by the russians, who tried to exploit the suspected weakness of the commonwealth after the unexpected death of sigismund iii. however, they failed to regain smolensk. mikhail shein surrendered to władysław iv on 1 march 1634, and the russians accepted the treaty of polyanovka in may 1634. the russians had to pay 20,000 rubles to the commonwealth, but władysław relinquished his claim to the russian throne and recognized michael as the legitimate tsar of russia, also returning the russian royal insignia. modern legacy the story of the dymitriads and false dimitrys proved useful to future generations of rulers and politicians in poland and russia, and a distorted version of the real events gained much fame in russia, as well as in poland. in poland the dmitriads campaign is remembered as the height of the polish golden age, the time poles captured moscow, something that even four million troops from adolf hitler\\'s nazi germany and other axis powers could not manage. in russia it was useful to the new dynasty of tsars, the romanovs, who understood that history is a powerful political tool, written by the victors. they tried to erase all references and theories to their role in creating the false dmitrys, self-interested cooperation with polish and swedish interventions, or their opposition to the liberal unia troista; instead they supported a portrayal of dmitriads as the heroic defense of russian nation against the barbaric invasion of polish-jesuit alliance, who attempted to destroy the russian orthodox culture. this was the history line shown by the famous russian historian, nikolai mikhailovich karamzin, beautifully described by aleksandr pushkin in his \"boris godunov\" and by modest mussorgsky in his opera boris godunov, and later romanticized in the film minin and pozharsky by vsevolod pudovkin. the monument to minin and pozharsky was erected in moscow\\'s red square in 1818. the communist regime of the soviet union also found this war a useful propaganda tool, especially during the times of the polish-soviet war. the dymitriads were also useful for the propaganda of józef piłsudski\\'s polish government between the world wars. in post-soviet russia the only autumn holiday, the national unity day, first celebrated on 4 november 2005, commemorates the popular uprising that ejected the occupying force from moscow in november 1612, and more generally the end of the time of troubles and foreign interventions in russia. its name alludes to the idea that all the classes of the russian society willingly united to preserve the russian statehood when its demise seemed inevitable, even though there was neither tsar nor patriarch to guide them. president vladimir putin reestablished the holiday in 2004, replacing the commemoration of the october revolution which formerly took place on 7 november, likely to reinforce a history of russian nationalism over that of communism (or revolution). see also prince władysław\\'s march on moscow livonian war (1577-1582) moldavian magnate

       " 'luís gonzaga pinto da gama (21 june 1830 - 24 august 1882) was a brazilian (self-taught lawyer), abolitionist, orator, journalist and writer, and the patron of the abolition of slavery in brazil. born to a free black mother and a white father, he was nevertheless made a slave at the age of 10, and remained illiterate until the age of 17. he judicially won his own freedom and began to work as a lawyer on behalf of the captives, and by the age of 29 he was already an established author and considered \"the greatest abolitionist in brazil\". although considered one of the exponents of , works such as manuel bandeira\\'s \"apresentação da poesia brasileira\" do not even mention his name. he had such a unique life that it is difficult to find, among his biographers, any who do not become passionate when portraying him - being himself also charged with passion, emotional and yet captivating. he was a black intellectual in 19th century slave-owning brazil, the only self-taught and the only one to have gone through the experience of captivity. he spent his life fighting for the abolition of slavery and for the end of the monarchy in brazil, but died six years before these causes were accomplished. in 2018 his name was inscribed in the steel book of national heroes deposited in the tancredo neves pantheon of the fatherland and freedom. panorama from the time são paulo, where gama lived for forty-two years, was in the middle of the 19th century a still small provincial capital that, with the demand for coffee production from the 1870s on, saw the price of slaves reach a level that made their urban possession almost prohibitive. until this period, however, it was quite common the property of \"rent slaves\", on whose work their owners drew their source of sustenance, alongside the so-called \"domestic slaves\". it had a population ten times smaller than that of the court (rio de janeiro), and a very strong presence of legal culture because, since 1828, one of the only two law schools in the country had been established there, the largo de são francisco law school, which received students from all over the country, coming from all social strata - besides the children of the rural oligarchy, members of the intellectual elite that was being formed at the time (gama defined it, then, as \"noah\\'s ark in a small way\"). childhood and slavery luís gama was born on june 21, 1830, at bângala street nº2, in the centre from the city of salvador, bahia. even with little information about his childhood, it is known that he was the son of luísa mahin, a freed african ex-slave, and the son of a portuguese fidalgo who lived in bahia. at the age of seven, his mother traveled to rio de janeiro to participate in the sabinada revolt, never to meet him again. in 1840, his father ended up in debt with gambling, so he resorted to selling luís gama as a slave to pay his debts. there is no evidence that his father sought him out after that. as an adult, gama understood that when he was sold he was a victim of the crime of \"enslaving a free person, who is in possession of his freedom.\", provided in article 179 from criminal code of the empire of brazil, sanctioned shortly after his birth. furthermore, due to the fact that the revolts that took place in bahia led to the prohibition of the sale of slaves from this province to other regions of brazil, the sale and transport of luís gama to são paulo was constituted as contraband. in an autobiographical letter he sent in 1880 to , he describes his birth and early childhood thus: lígia ferreira, one of the researchers who has most studied gama\\'s life, points out that this information could not be verified, although she stresses that the sobrado where he was born still exists; the register of his baptism could not be found, and adds to this the fact that the omission of his father\\'s name from his account casts doubt on his real identity. put up for sale, he was rejected \"for being bahian\". after the malê revolt, a stigma was created that bahian captives were rebellious and more likely to run away. he was taken to rio de janeiro where he was sold to antonio pereira cardoso, a slave trader who took him to be resold in são paulo. from the port of santos, gama and the other slaves were taken on foot to be sold in jundiaí and campinas. with all the buyers resisting buying him because he was from bahia, gama began working as a domestic slave on the ensign\\'s property, washing and ironing clothes, and then became a , working as a seamstress and shoemaker in the town of lorena. freedom and adulthood in 1847, luís gama had contact with a law student, antônio rodrigues do prado júnior, who stayed at his master\\'s house and taught him the alphabet. the following year gama was already literate and had taught the ensign\\'s children to read, which he used as an argument in favor of his alforria, which was not successful. with this, luís gama was able to prove his freedom and joined the army in 1848. it remains unclear, however, the artifices used by luis gama to obtain his freedom, and it is suggested that he may have used the testimony of his father - whose identity he was careful to keep obscure. there is also the theory that gama would have run away from the estate and argued that he was free because he could read and write, which were skills that most slaves did not possess. he was part of the city guard from 1848 until 1854, when he was imprisoned for 39 days due to \"insoburdination\" after \"threatening an insolent officer\" who had insulted him. before that, in 1850, he had married claudina fortunata sampaio. even while serving in the army, he was chosen to work as a copyist for official authorities in his spare time, since he had good calligraphy. in 1856, he was hired as a clerk at the são paulo police department, in the office of francisco maria de souza furtado de mendonça, a counselor and law professor. with the knowledge of francisco mendonça and having his library at his disposal, luís gama further studied the subject of law until he made the decision to graduate from the largo de são francisco law school. however, the students of the faculty were against it, making it impossible for luís gama to enroll, so he began to study on his own, as attending classes as a listener and became a \"rábula\", the name given to the individual who had enough legal knowledge to be a lawyer, even without a law degree. after acting in slave cases, gama was dismissed from his position at the secretariat of police, in 1868, due to pressure from who were dissatisfied with the freedoms won by the rábula. gama defined his dismissal \"for the good of the public service\" as a consequence of the work he had been doing to free slaves who were in an illegal situation, in addition to denouncing the system\\'s abuses, or, in his words literature gama was a reader of the vida de jesus (life of jesus), by the french philosopher ernest renan, originally published in 1863 and soon translated in brazil, being one of the first to refer to it in the country. his only work, originally published in two editions (1859 and 1861), primeiras trovas burlescas, placed him in the literary pantheon of brazil only twelve years after he learned to read. this book, dedicated to salvador furtado de mendonça, a magistrate who taught at the largo de s. francisco and who also managed his library there (which allows us to infer that he facilitated gama\\'s access to his collection), also has poems by his friend josé bonifácio the younger, attached. the third edition of the work only came out posthumously, in 1904. poetry: the \"orpheus with a curly top\" recalling the figure of the greek poet orpheus, and alluding to his curly hair, gama was called \"orpheus with a curly top\", and mastered both lyric and satirical poetry. his poetics is written in the first person, without hiding his own origin and without failing to proclaim his blackness; at the same time, he does not fail to use the traditional images of his time, such as mythological evocations (like orpheus, cupid, etc.) or the poets of the past (like lamartine, camões, for example). however, gama reverts these images to his condition: the muse is from guinea, orpheus has \"curly top\". in portraying white society, he uses strongly satirical images: he builds, from the elements of white culture, the antithesis to the culture and civilization of the blacks, filling them with elements of traditional poetry; thus, he contrasts the \"guinea muse\" to the greco-roman muses; the dark granite to the white marble; the marimba and the cabaço to the lyre and the flute: in his verses, he traces an image of himself that is far from the figure of the \"poor wretch\" or sufferer that figures in the blacks painted by contemporary white poets like castro alves. gama hits himself with the same fierce criticism with which he attacks the system, belittling his own value before the prevailing cultural standards, which he implicitly accepts: gama even ironizes the situation of the black man, cut off from wealth, the sciences, and the arts: goat \"goat\" (bode) was a term used in gama\\'s time to make pejorative references to black and pardo people, more specifically, \"gathering of mixed-race people\", and the poet himself was the target of these offenses. thus, in 1861, in the poem quem sou eu? also known as bodarrada, gama used the term ironically to satirize brazilian society, while affirming human equality regardless of color: abolitionist activism journalism and freemasonry part of luís gama\\'s abolitionist activism resided in his activity in the press. he began his journalistic career in são paulo, together with cartoonist angelo agostini; both founded, in 1864, the first illustrated humorous newspaper in that city, called (lame devil), which lasted from october 1864 until november 1865. before this, however, he had been an apprentice printer at o ipiranga and had worked in the editorial staff of radical paulistano. his actions as a journalist and lawyer, as early as 1869, had made him one of the most influential and popular figures in the city of são paulo. despite this, gama did not become a rich man and kept what little money he had to donate to the needy who came to him. luís gama was the only black abolitionist in brazil to have experienced slavery. but gama also wrote articles for other newspapers, in which he discoursed on socio-racial issues of imperial brazil. in an article entitled foro de belém de jundiaí, published in , gama denounces the decision of a judge who, after the death of a slave master, allowed the auction of a former slave who had been freed by his heir son. his journalistic and legal actions brought him many enemies, and the author julio emílio braz even claims that dioguinho was hired to assassinate him when gama was nearing the end of his life, but a letter written to his son on september 23, 1870 makes it clear that he had been suffering threats against his life for some time. in 1866, still with agostini, now joined by , they founded the hebdomadário ; all three belonged to the same masonic lodge, and shared the same republican and abolitionist ideals. the america masonic lodge was very active in the abolitionist cause; it was founded by luís gama and ruy barbosa and joaquim nabuco (who omits his masonic background) may also have been a member. at the time of his death, gama was the institution\\'s venerable master. one of his projects within the freemasonry was, in june 1869, through the america lodge and together with olímpio da paixão, the creation of a free school for children and an evening primary school for adults in the 25 de março street. historian bruno rodrigues de lima also found a manuscript that presents the idea that gama had been responsible for the creation of a community library with 5 thousand titles, something that was attributed to the loja américa, and his manifestos published in the newspaper \"democracia\" demonstrate his commitment to a project of a public and secular school at least 30 years before the first debates on this subject. the \"gama style\" of judicial practice in 1831, a law was passed that prohibited the importation of slaves into brazil, making any trafficked individual free as soon as he or she arrived in the country. called the , it became better known as a , because it was a law passed to appease british pressure for the abolition of slavery in brazil, without actually putting an end to the importation of slaves. although it was not a law enforced by slave traders, it was the legal instrument by which gama used to achieve the liberation of slaves. the so-called \"gama style\" consisted of proving through legal proceedings that the enslaved blacks defended by gama were brought illegally to brazil, that is, after the promulgation of the feijó law in 1831, and should therefore be freed. with the promulgation of the lei do ventre livre (free womb law) in 1871, gama was able to get more freed slaves. in one of the items of the law, it was established the requirement of registration of each slave that a master owned. if the slave did not have a registration, it could be used as an argument for his alforria, as gama did. also, article 4 of the law formalized the purchase of the slave\\'s manumission charter by the slave himself or by others, which allowed abolitionists to pass themselves off as slave valuers and lower the purchase price, allowing gama and other abolitionists to buy more freedoms at lower prices. although he acted mainly in the defense of blacks accused of crimes, of those who fled or to seek their legal freedoms, he did not refuse to attend gracefully to the poor of any ethnicity, and there were cases in which he defended european immigrants injured by brazilians. gama also helped newly freed slaves find a job. in his autobiographical letter to lúcio de mendonça, gama estimates that he had already freed more than 500 slaves from captivity and in an 1869 court case known as the \"netto question\", gama secured the freedom of 217 slaves, in an act regarded as the \"largest known collective action to free slaves in the americas,\" according to the bbc. during a jury, gama uttered a phrase that became famous: the slave who kills the master, in whatever circumstance, always kills in self-defense - this provoked such a reaction from those present that, with the confusion, the judge was forced to suspend the session. historian ligia fonseca ferreira says that this phrase actually appeared in the biography of luís gama written by lúcio de mendonça and published in the almanaque literário de são paulo, explaining that \"this phrase is not by luiz gama, it is by this white friend who wrote about him\". an article in the estado de são paulo also says that gama never wrote these words in exact, and historian bruno rodrigues de lima says that this concept reappears several times in his work. in one example, in the letter to ferreira de menezes dated december 18, 1880, when defending 4 slaves considered \"four spartacus\" by gama, who had murdered the son of their master valeriano josé do vale, and had been executed by 300 people while inside the prison by \"...the knife, the stick, the hoe, the axe...\", gama said: an equivalent sentence was published on august 19, 1882 as the subtitle of the article \"to the slavocrats\", written by raul pompeia, in the abolitionist center\\'s newspaper \"ça ira\": \"before the law, the crime of homicide perpetrated by the slave in the person of the master is justifiable\". ethnic views luís gama was against african descendants who acted like whites or even became cruel slavers, and he thought it was funny to see slavers of multi-ethnic origin trying to pass themselves off as whites. about his father, he said, \"my father, i dare not claim that he was white, because such claims, in this country, constitute grave danger before the truth\". colonel teodoro xavier hated luís gama for having already lost a slave to him, so he called him \"goat\", trying to insult him, to which one day, the lawyer replied: \"i am not a goat, i am black. my color does not deny it. a goat is your honor who intends to disguise, with this light color, the mulatto underneath\". political activity in his political activities gama was affiliated to liberal party and before the he had already exposed his ideas in the article \"the american brazil and the lands of cruzeiro without king or slaves\" published on december 2, 1869. later, gama was part of the group that for the first time tried to found a republican party and on july 2, 1873, he came to participate in the first republican congress, already part of the paulista republican party, where he found that the party and its members, many slave owners, did not care or interest themselves in the abolitionist agenda. because he believed that abolition should be immediate and without compensation to the slaveholders, he left the party and started criticizing it in the media, and these criticisms also extended to newspapers that claimed to be in favor of the abolitionist cause, but published advertisements about the capture of slaves. death and burial the writer raul pompeia had already noticed that gama\\'s health was not good; three days before his death he had observed that gama no longer climbed down the stairs of his office without support, resorting to the support of his friends pedro, brasil silvado, or himself, raul. gama had diabetes. on the morning of august 24, 1882 he had lost his speech and despite the intervention of more than 20 doctors, this was the causa mortis that victimized him that afternoon, certified by physician jaime perna. when the great abolitionist and slave liberator had died, raul pompeia expressed his incredulity and, registering every moment of the funeral, he immediately went to his friend\\'s house, where he verified that many people were already there, keeping vigil: in front of the house, men cried \"like cowards\", and ladies sobbed. his body had been placed in a coffin in the front room; a sculptor molded his face in plaster. the coffin left the next day at three o\\'clock in the afternoon. just before the coffin was closed, the widow gave a painful cry. the cemetery was at the other end of town, and a funeral coach had been prepared to take him, but the crowd of people who had flocked there would not let him go: \"everyone\\'s friend\" - as he was known - would have to be \"carried by everyone\". commerce had closed its doors and flowers were thrown to gama. the coffin appears, brought by friends of the deceased: journalist and member of the centro abolicionista gaspar da silva, dr. antônio carlos, dr. pinto ferraz, , among others; ahead of the coffin followed a huge crowd, like the one squeezed in beside, disputing the honor of carrying the coffin; behind, a large number of carriages and, among them, the empty funeral coach. at four hours and five minutes, the procession arrived at brás, where a band was waiting to accompany it, playing sad chords; at , the brotherhood of nossa senhora dos remédios joined the burial; arriving at the \"city\", stores closed their doors and flags were flying at half-mast, while people crowded the streets where the burial was to take place; in the windows, families squeezed themselves to watch: all along the way, many mourned the loss. professor otávio torres recorded that luís gama died \"glorified by são paulo\"; antônio loureiro de sousa, in 1949, recorded: \"his funeral was an unprecedented spectacle: it was the largest ever reported in those days. the crowd that followed the funeral cortege, with all silence and admiration, was forced to stop by the numerous speeches that interrupted the funeral procession\". more recently, in 2013, article writer zeca borges declared that \"his burial was the most emotional event in the history of the city of são paulo\". people of all classes were there, and all vying for the chance to carry the skiff. at one point, the slave driver carried on one side, and on the other, a haughty, \"poor, ragged, barefooted black man\", in pompey\\'s register. it was already evening when the procession finally arrived at the consolação holy ground, and the crowd held its ground. after a brief stop for a sermon by a priest in the chapel, where the hundreds of wreaths of flowers were laid, the coffin was finally taken to the grave, where the crowd was waiting. before lowering it, however, someone - the doctor or , shouted for everyone to wait; after a brief speech in which he remembered the importance of luís gama, bringing everyone to tears, he summoned everyone to swear an oath not to let \"die the idea for which that giant had fought\": this was answered by a general roar from the crowd, which, hands extended to the coffin, swore. his grave was purchased on the same day as the burial in the name of his wife claudina, as recorded in book 2, fols. 28, of the municipal archives; it is located on 2nd street, grave 17. effects from the speeches gama\\'s death and the engaged speech at his grave marked the end of this first phase of the abolitionist movement, markedly \"legalistic\" (constitution of funds for the acquisition of captives and their freedom, legal actions for liberation) and the beginning of the phase of effective actions to combat the slavers: led by clímaco barbosa, the campaign moved on to \"de facto ways\", where people took in runaway slaves, hiding them in their homes until they were sent to the quilombo do jabaquara, in santos, and stimulating mass escape from the farms. a milestone of this action was the invasion of chácara pari by members of the brás abolitionist club, with cries of \"long live the abolitionists, let the slavocrats die!\"; people such as barbosa, antônio bento, feliciano bicudo, among other notables and anonymous, became part of the police\\'s list of suspects. in 1879, recognizing that his illness was worsening, luís gama began to consider radical methods and antônio bento, who had left his position as a judge to dedicate himself to the anti-slavery struggle was of paramount importance in this area and was later considered \"the ghost of abolition\". antônio bento inherited the position of lawyer for the abolitionist club upon gama\\'s death. later came the abolitionist party and the caifazes movement, led by antônio bento, who radicalized the abolitionist campaign in actions as described in the first paragraph of the topic, which made antônio bento the immediate continuator of luís gama\\'s work. homages and influences among his contemporaries gama was the recipient of several tributes. raul pompeia, in the of september 10, 1882, wrote an article about him entitled última página da vida de um grande homem (last page in the life of a great man); the same author wrote a caricature of him, which was published that same year on the front page of the rio de janeiro newspaper o mequetrefe in august (no. 284), and also the unfinished novella a mão de luís gama (the hand of luís gama), originally published on the pages of the jornal do commercio, of são paulo (1883), and the text a morte de luíz gama (the death of luíz gama). some years after his death, and following the abolition, the luís gama lodge was founded by the são paulo freemason góes and the collaboration of brothers from the trabalho and ordem e progresso lodges, with the initiation of 25 blacks. in his honor, in 1919, the (currently fepasa named one of its stations, today practically in ruins. between 1923 and 1926, in what may be considered the \"second period of the black press\" in the state of são paulo, the newspaper getulino appeared in the city of campinas; in this city racism was stronger than in the state capital itself, and the publication was part of the movement for greater participation of blacks in society; its title was a \"tribute to luís gama who had as one of his pseudonyms getulino\" and its influence would culminate in the creation of o clarim da alvorada, a newspaper in the são paulo capital. in , in são paulo, there is a erected to his memory, erected on commission by the black community on the occasion of his centennial. over time it influenced several black brazilian movements, such as the literary group projeto rhumor negro of são paulo, created in 1988, for whom gama\\'s letter to mendonça is \"one of the most important historical documents of the brazilian people. (...) given the magnitude of the life of this great man, this letter, crossing time, is also addressed to all of us\". in 2014, in the wake of the success of the movie 12 years a slave, writer ana maria gonçalves, author of the novelized work about gama\\'s life um defeito de cor (a color defect), prepared a script for a movie and also drawing the attention of brazilian television - pointing out that very little is said about slavery compared to other historical facts, such as the holocaust during world war ii. in 2015 the play \"luiz gama — uma voz pela liberdade\" (\"luiz gama - a voice for freedom\") was started, with actor and scriptwriter deo garcez as the protagonist and actress nivia helen as narrator and various characters. in 2015, the ordem dos advogados do brasil conceded the title of attorney of law to luis gama in a ceremony in the law school of mackenzie presbyterian university. this homage was proposed by professor silvio almeida, president of luiz gama institute, and nowadays minister of human rights and citizenship of brazil. in 2017, the university of são paulo law school, in , named one of its rooms after him. in 2018 his name was inscribed in the steel book of national heroes deposited in the tancredo neves pantheon of the fatherland and freedom and was recognized as a journalist by the . in 2019, it was announced that filmmaker would make a film on the life of gama, with as the character in adulthood. the film, then in production, was temporarily titled prisioneiro da liberdade (prisoner of liberty), also would feature actors caio blat and zezé motta. the name of the film came to be doutor gama, with as the main character, and was released in 2021. also in 2019, the comic book província negra was published after winning the city of são paulo\\'s fomento cultural edict, portraying a fictional adventure based on the life of gama, who takes on the role of the protagonist in the adventure. the script is by kaled kanbour and the art by kris zullo. in 2021, the university of são paulo posthumously awarded him an honoris causa doctorate, the first black brazilian to receive this title from the university. title of \"lawyer\" 133 years after his death, on november 3, 2015, the order of attorneys of brazil, são paulo section, granted him the title of \"lawyer\", since he was not trained and acted as a \"provisioned\" or abolitionist. the tribute ceremony, entitled \"luiz gama: ideas and legacy of the abolitionist leader\", included two days of events at mackenzie presbyterian university, through debates and lectures. the tribute is unprecedented in the history of the order of attorneys of brazil; according to its national president, , \"it is a very fitting tribute to someone who fought so hard for freedom, equality, and respect\". image abroad the black past website, focused on global african and african american history, has a page with the poet\\'s biography. in march 2020, the workshop \"slavery, freedom and civil law in the brazilian courts (1860-1888): how the black lawyer luiz gama developed a legal doctrine that freed five hundred slaves\" took place at princeton university. complete work historian bruno rodrigues de lima, from the max planck institute, spent nine years going through archives and registry offices looking for the complete works of luís gama, in a project for the publication of ten volumes and approximately 5,000 pages in portuguese entitled obras completas [complete works (of luiz gama)], alongside the publisher hedra. the project, published out of order, will be fully released by 2022. bruno rodrigues has researched to create luís gama\\'s timeline starting when he published his first text at the age of 19, and among his research findings is the fact that he was already recognized as a lawyer in his time, not a rábula- and that this denomination may have been created to diminish him. notes references bibliography scientific papers books additional reading - used in the article body on oldid=1039809695 - used in the article body on oldid=1039809695 - used in the article body on oldid=1039809695 external links a biography of luís gama (in english) a biography of luís gama organization dedicated to luiz gama (in portuguese) 1830 births 1882 deaths 19th-century brazilian lawyers brazilian journalists romantic poets brazilian abolitionists people from salvador, bahia deaths from diabetes 19th-century journalists brazilian male journalists 19th-century brazilian poets brazilian male poets 19th-century brazilian male writers brazilian freemasons',\n",
       " 'ratsat or demosat was an aluminum mass simulator on the fourth flight of the falcon 1 rocket, launched on 28 september 2008. ratsat remained bolted to the second stage of the carrier rocket after reaching low earth orbit. it is an aluminium alloy chamber in hexagonal prism shape with 1.5 m (5 ft) length. the falcon 1 launch that carried ratsat to orbit was the first successful orbital launch of any privately funded and developed, liquid-propellant carrier rocket, the spacex falcon 1, something only six nations had successfully accomplished previously. the launch, identified as falcon 1 flight 4, was conducted by spacex, and also marked the first time the falcon 1 rocket successfully achieved orbit, after three consecutive failures on the three previous launch attempts. background three consecutive flights of the falcon 1 rocket had ended in failure. in particular, during the third launch of the falcon 1 in august 2008, the first stage of the rocket after stage separation have residual thrust and slammed into its second stage, resulting in catastrophic damage to the second stage\\'s kestrel engine. though the fix for the problem is simple - add a time delay between main engine cut off and stage separation - spacex was running out of money and there was much uncertainty that there will be a fourth flight for the company. as for spacex\\'s ceo elon musk, he was in immense stress financially and personally, as both of his ventures, spacex and tesla inc., were at risk of bankruptcy due to a series of failures. he was also recently divorced with justine musk which after property settlement made him homeless, and also lost their first son due to sids. preparation shipping to omelek right after the third launch failure, musk made an encouraging speech for the spacex employees and told them to launch another rocket in six weeks. according to musk, this tight schedule was necessary or else the company would be in bankruptcy. the rocket was built out of spare parts laying around in the factory. the fourth launch of the falcon 1 was supposed to deliver the malaysian government\\'s razaksat satellite, but the malaysian government has backed out and no other customer was willing to launch on a thrice-failed rocket. therefore, the spacex team had to make a non-functional aluminum boilerplate to simulate the rocket\\'s payload. the boilerplate weighed and named \"ratsat\" after the last names of jeff richichi, ray amador and chris thompson, who were part of the company\\'s structures team. the design for ratsat\\'s logo was inspired by ed roth t-shirts, whom thompson admired. normally, falcon 1\\'s first stage would be shipped by a container to omelek island, kwajalein atoll, u.s. (where spacex launched the rocket) and falcon 1\\'s second stage would fly out to the island using the douglas dc-8 aircraft. the first stage was too big to be flown out using a dc-8. however, the tight schedule mandated the first stage to be shipped over air, so after scrambling with military contacts, a spacex employee was able to book a flight on the u.s. air force\\'s boeing c-17 globemaster iii with a price of $500,000. being much larger than the dc-8, the c-17 can easily fit the rocket\\'s first stage (which its dry mass weighs compared to the c-17 carrying capacity of ) and twenty supporting employees.on 3 september, the c-17 landed at the los angeles international airport near spacex\\'s headquarters, loaded up, and took off without issues. an intentional small opening in the falcon 1\\'s oxygen tank fuel pressurization line was made to equalize the rocket\\'s internal pressure with the surroundings. this approach worked well enough for the rocket tanks to slowly release its pressure while the plane was ascending. however, when it was time for the plane to descend to hawaii and the cabin depressurized, the small opening did not allow air to pass into the rocket tanks fast enough. thus, the falcon 1 imploded, right next to the supporting crew. had the spacex crews were not onboard the flight, the falcon 1 would be ditched to the sea. with only 30 minutes of fuel left and the rocket continued to crumble, the crew cut the shrink wraps with their knives and took the wrench in the toolbox. one of the crews crawled inside the falcon 1\\'s interstage (piece that connects the first and second stage of the rocket) with the wrench and detached a pressurization line inside, allowing air to pass inside. the crumbling oxygen tank was inflated back to shape, though it had sustained damages to its structure. the c-17 landed at the hickam air force base, hawaii at midnight; the spacex crews slept here because they forgot to book a proper resting location. the next morning, the crews and rocket took off from hawaii and landed on an airstrip in the kwajalein atoll. a barge then carried the first stage of the rocket to the omelek island. rocket fixes and tests using a borescope, a slosh baffle was found detached from the tank body, and it was clear that the falcon 1 needed a total disassembly. a \\'proper\\' six-weeks long fixing procedure was proposed, but it was promptly rejected because by then, spacex would not have any funds and would be bankrupted. another solution suggesting shipping back the rocket to the headquarters was also not viable for the same reason. the only viable option was to disassemble the rocket on the island itself, within one week. as the engineers were working on the rocket, a crew sen the falcon 1 rocket was successfully test-fired on 20 september. launch preparations on 23 september led the ground crew to replace part of a pipeline supplying liquid oxygen to the second stage kestrel engine. this work delayed the launch to 28 september. launch the launch occurred from omelek island, part of the kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands. liftoff occurred at 23:15 utc on 28 september, 15 minutes into a five-hour launch window. if the launch had been scrubbed, it could have been conducted during the same window until 1 october. nine minutes and 31 seconds after launch, the second stage engine shut down, after the vehicle reached orbit. the initial orbit was reported to be approximately . following a coast period, the second stage restarted, and performed a successful second burn, resulting in a final orbit of at 9.35° inclination. it was falcon 1\\'s first successful launch, and the first successful orbital launch of any privately funded and developed, liquid-propellant carrier rocket. the rocket followed the same trajectory as the previous flight, which had failed to place the trailblazer, nanosail-d, presat and celestis explorers spacecraft into orbit. no major changes were made to the rocket, other than increasing the time between first stage burnout and second stage separation. this minor change addressed the failure seen on the previous flight, recontact between the first and second stages, by dissipating residual thrust in the enhanced first stage engine in vacuum before separation. although spacex was working on concepts to recover the first stage of falcon 1 launch vehicles, as of this launch, they had not yet succeeded in doing so. stage recovery was a non-primary goal of the early flights. spacex utilized an incremental development process to iterate the design issues of booster stage recovery. ceo elon musk stated that the probability of a successful recovery would increase with subsequent flights, however the falcon 1 was subsequently retired from service after its fifth launch, with first stage recovery never having been accomplished successfully. the first stage of the successor rocket, the falcon 9, became reusable. see also 2008 in spaceflight references further reading photo section, page i-1 - i-16, at spacecraft launched by falcon rockets derelict satellites orbiting earth spacecraft launched in 2008 test spaceflights',\n",

       " 'stanley \"stan\" falkow (january 24, 1934 - may 5, 2018) was an american microbiologist and a professor of microbiology at georgetown university, university of washington, and stanford university school of medicine. falkow is known as the father of the field of molecular microbial pathogenesis. he formulated molecular koch\\'s postulates, which have guided the study of the microbial determinants of infectious diseases since the late 1980s. falkow spent over 50 years uncovering molecular mechanisms of how bacteria cause disease and how to disarm them. falkow also was one of the first scientists to investigate antimicrobial resistance, and presented his research extensively to scientific, government, and lay audiences explaining the spread of resistance from one organism to another, now known as horizontal gene transfer, and the implications of this phenomenon on our ability to combat infections in the future. early life and education falkow was born into a yiddish-speaking household in albany, new york. his father was a shoe salesman and had immigrated from soviet kyiv, ukraine. his mother came from a family of jewish immigrants from poland. she \"rented several of their bedrooms and later opened a corset shop\". falkow\\'s family was working-class to poor as he described in his memoir. he was therefore a first-generation jewish american. falkow worked at a toy shop in order to collect enough money to buy a model microscope, as well as admitted to stealing textbooks, one a nurse\\'s book on infectious diseases, in order to explore microbiology as a career path despite his family\\'s financial situation. falkow attributed his early interest in microbiology to reading microbe hunters in 1943, when he was 11 years old, which he found at the public library after the family had moved to newport, rhode island. the book is a dramatization of microbiological research written by american microbiologist paul de kruif. because of poor grades until his senior year of high school, an adviser suggested military rather than college. falkow described himself as an average student, and below average at mathematics, which he later rectified by working through workbooks of high school and college level mathematics later in his career, after earning his ph.d., in order to analyze and design experiments. in his memoir, falkow gives credit to his teachers and acknowledges the role that the systemic oppression of women in america in the 1940s-1950s played in his life, stating \"i now understand that i was the beneficiary of the repression of women by our society. the best and brightest women in many communities were relegated to the one intellectual role deemed suitable for them. they became teachers and many poured their love of language, science, music and art into students like me.\" education and career falkow enrolled in biology at the university of maine, because of their microbiology department. during the summers he worked in pathology at the hospital in newport, staining slides and assisting in autopsies. he graduated in 1955. before he started graduate school at university of michigan he developed extreme anxiety. he was later diagnosed with agoraphobia. he avoided movie theaters and crowded places between 1955 and 1983 and dropped out of his first attempt at graduate school because of recurring panic attacks. he returned to rhode island to live with his parents and work at the newport hospital as a technician, focusing on bacteriology and processing and examining patient samples. he re-enrolled in graduate school at brown university and graduated with a phd in 1961. he finished his work for his ph.d. thesis at the walter reed army institute of research (wrair) in the department of bacterial immunology. while at walter reed, he worked with african-american microbiologist othello washington. washington was older and more experienced than falkow, but was assigned to be stan\\'s technician. upon meeting, falkow and washington decided it would be more appropriate and better for both men to work together as a team. the two men worked together on isolating mobile genetic elements and the transfer of genes between e. coli and salmonella and published a paper together about proteus species. falkow also worked with shigella species and contracted dysentery, which lead to hospitalization, after being exposed to infected monkey feces flung at his face by an infected monkey. multiple times through his training and early career more senior scientists, some nobel prize winners, recommended that falkow focus more on mechanisms of gene expression and less on pathogens because \"nobody cares about typhoid\". falkow remained interested in pathogens despite many warnings from his peers and supervisors that infectious diseases were not interesting and were becoming less frequent in wealthy countries and were therefore a diminishing field of study. his early work in the 1960s focused on the genetic mechanisms, which enable bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. he showed that organisms, such as shigella, can possess dna fragments called plasmids which exist apart from the bacterial chromosome, and that they carry specialized information for survival. under selective pressure from antibiotics, one species of bacteria can pass its plasmids to another directly without mating, thereby preserving its own specialized survival genes. in 1966, he joined georgetown university school of medicine as a professor of microbiology. he later moved to seattle to join the faculty of the department of microbiology and immunology at the university of washington school of medicine. here he described how meningitis and gonorrhea organisms acquire plasmids to become resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics. in the 1970s, falkow shifted his focus to the infection process. during this period, he showed that a life-threatening diarrhea prevalent in many developing countries is caused by a sub-type of e. coli. he also co-authored (with royston c. clowes, stanley n. cohen, roy curtiss iii, naomi datta and richard novick) a proposal for uniform nomenclature for bacterial plasmids. in 1981, he was named chairman of the department of medical microbiology at stanford university school of medicine, a position he held until 1985. while at stanford, falkow encouraged esther lederberg to continue directing the stanford plasmid reference center, an internationally used registry for plasmids, transposons and insertion sequences.) personal life and death falkow was married to rhoda ostroff in january, 1958 with whom he had two daughters. they divorced in 1983. in december, 1983, he married lucy s. tompkins. falkow and tompkins met while he was a professor at georgetown university, and she was a medical student who sought falkow out to work in his lab. at first, falkow denied the opportunity to tompkins, claiming that he would not take female graduate students because he was not comfortable having a female student, which was common in the scientific field in the 1960s. tompkins rebutted his misogyny firmly, and explicitly pointed out that he was discriminating against her based on her gender. her argument forced stan to reconsider his bias and he then allowed her to enter his laboratory as a trainee. for the remainder of his career falkow continued to hire women trainees, and by the end of his career most of his trainees were female. falkow later became an advocate and ally of gender equality in science and helped encourage many women to pursue scientific careers. falkow had on-going severe anxiety throughout his career. due to his anxiety early in his career he avoided conferences, airplanes, and giving presentations in general due to the fact that he would shake and sweat noticeably during them. falkow described his struggle with his mental health as an \"uneasy truce\" with his \"demons\" later on in his career as he learned various coping mechanisms. because of his anxiety during public speaking, he often employed humor in his teaching and presentations to help cope with the tension of a silent audience, which also lead to most of the audience members finding his talks memorable and enjoyable. falkow kept his condition a secret from his colleagues during his early career, only privately revealing to arthur saz, the chair of microbiology at georgetown university school of medicine, that he received and benefited from psychoanalysis treatment. health insurance for mental health treatment was much better for military employees than academics at the time, and a major reason falkow continued to work at the walter reed army institute of research for as long as he did early in his career, but falkow agreed to a job at georgetown university because of this disclosure, upon which the chair privately organized falkow\\'s healthcare benefits to cover his psychoanalysis treatments. in 2004 falkow was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome and given a prognosis of two years. he died on may 5, 2018, at the age of 84 at his home in portola valley, california, of myelodysplastic syndrome. his death was announced and lifetime achievements highlighted in obituaries in the new york times, washington post, nature, science, in a press release from the americain society of microbiology and in various international news sources. contributions molecular microbiology research falkow has been referred to as the \"father of molecular microbial pathogenesis\", the study of how infectious microbes and host cells interact to cause disease at the molecular level. falkow adopted the perspective of viewing infection as a process that is ultimately dependent on both the infecting agent and the host. he discovered that infectious microbes employ genes that are activated only inside host cells. his work carries clinical applications, such as a new vaccine for whooping cough. from enteric pathogens to sexually transmitted diseases to respiratory infections, his influence has left virtually no field untouched. falkow and his first graduate student, richard p. silver, discovered that episomes (plasmids) are nicked into linear pieces of dna and transported as linear dna between two bacterial cells during conjugation. he then collaborated with mexican scientists emma galindo and jorge olarte to investigate new forms of penicillin resistance in shigella isolates from pediatric patients in mexico city, which lead to the discovery of new forms of \"r factors\" - genes responsible for antimicrobial resistance. falkow and trainee joan skerman knapp identified a virulence factor on plasmids of e. coli found in human feces, demonstrating for the first time that the ability to cause disease may be transferable between bacteria. falkow was present at the famous waikiki beach meeting in 1972 between herb boyer (who provided the restriction enzyme ecori) and stanley cohen (who provided the plasmid) that led to a plan to develop recombinant dna technology. this led to the first cloning of a bacterial virulence factor, the heat stable toxin of e. coli, in a seminal 1976 paper with magdalene yh so, which heralded the application of molecular genetics to understanding gene transfer, and ultimately led to the creation of the field of synthetic biology. falkow and his trainees developed many methods that moved biological research forward such as: a method for screening patient samples for enteric pathogens, the identification of salmonella and shigella in patient samples based on lysine metabolism, the application of nucleic acid hybridization to distinguish different bacterial species, the application of agarose gels to isolate plasmids of various sizes, isolation and creation of different plasmid backbones now used as cloning vectors, a method for identifying unculturable pathogens based on isolated 16s ribosomal rna sequence, an optimized version of gfp for flow cytometry applications, and a fluorescence-based method for the detection of genes expressed by pathogens inside of host cells, among many other techniques. after studying the dna content of many different pathogenic microbes, falkow became one of the first scientists to suggest bacterial taxonomy should be based on dna composition rather than phenotypic observations. falkow and others created the universal nomenclature scheme for plasmids still in use today. falkow established ‘molecular koch\\'s postulates\\' for defining virulence determinants, which continues to influence thinking and experimental design in infectious disease research. teaching and service falkow valued and enjoyed teaching as a fundamental part of scientific training and believed that all scientists have a duty to teach and train the next generation. in all of his years of employment at academic institutions, he taught students in some capacity between medical, graduate, undergraduate courses and invited lectures for courses whenever he was able to. in 2010, he recorded lectures on microbial pathogenesis for ibiology, and those videos are still publicly available on the ibiology website and on youtube. when falkow became an emeritus professor at stanford university, he still taught students. indeed, he co-taught with lucy tompkins a class open to undergraduate and graduate students on the history of infectious disease. falkow organized the first international symposium of invited speakers on antimicrobial resistance. falkow and his student vickers herschfield investigated water sources in the d.c. area to find examples of plasmids containing antimicrobial resistance genes. unexpectedly, they found that the potomac river and rock creek, considered \"clean\" water sources used for recreation at the time, were full of fecal waste and alerted many government offices about their findings, which were at first largely ignored. in the summer of 1971, falkow held a press conference warning d.c. citizens not to let their children play in the potomac river, stating \"one cup of potomac river water is equivalent to a half gram of human feces\". falkow served on the first nih recombinant dna committee to recommend policy guidelines for the use of recombinant dna to the united states of america congress. many of falkow\\'s publications are referenced in the recombinant dna regulation act of 1977. falkow worked with the fda of the united states throughout his career to advocate for the decrease of antimicrobial agents

       " \"cabralism is the period from 1842 to 1846 when antónio bernardo da costa cabral dominated portuguese politics. cabralism was characterized by the adoption of the constitutional doctrine contained in the restored constitutional charter of 1826, which was taken as a dogma to be scrupulously respected, thus creating a stable framework that was exploited by the government. the government was characterized by being a strong executive, decisively supported by the royal powers enshrined in the charter, especially the reserve power vested in the sovereign. history with the express support of queen maria ii, of whom costa cabral was considered a valedictorian, the government's parliamentary front was secured by an obedient majority, congregated in an exclusivist party and committed to maintaining, against the onslaughts of the left and the remnants of miguelism, the order deemed necessary for the country's development. one of the first reforms of cabralism was administrative centralization, approving the administrative code of 1842. this was followed by the reform of portugal's national guards, one of the previous factors of instability, the resumption of relations with the holy see and the control of foreign debt and the government deficit. cabralism attempted to launch an ambitious public works program, creating public-private partnerships with the creation of state creditor companies. on the social front, it legislated on public education and health, trying to modernize these sectors. having to take out a loan of 2400 escudos, an astronomical sum at the time, he was forced into a tax reform aimed at increasing state revenue, which began a rapid process of erosion of the popular support base for the government. in a clear show of favor, queen maria ii appointed costa cabral an effective councillor of state (1843), a peer of the realm (1844) and elevated him to count of tomar (1845), for two lives. however, the rapid enrichment of costa cabral, who, from the position of a modest lawyer, in a few years became the holder of a considerable fortune, which included a palace capable of hosting the queen, as well as the nepotism of which he was accused, since his brother josé bernardo da silva cabral, also made 1st count of tomar, was also accused of nepotism. silva cabral, who also became the 1st count of cabral, was one of the government's supporters (hence the name government of the cabral), making costa cabral a figure hated by vast swathes of the population. when his other brother and his father also entered parliament, accusations of nepotism, clientelism and concussion in public tenders grew. when, in january 1846, the unstoppable increase in public spending and the consequent state deficit led to the state's credit being cut off, making bankruptcy imminent, cabralism fell into agony. thus, despite having completed the legislature, and having been the first government of portuguese liberalism to achieve this feat, popular discontent was such that the slightest agitation threatened to result in an uprising. this is what happened in the spring of 1846 with the maria da fonte revolution. the end of cabralism faced with the spread of the popular uprising, the queen was forced to dismiss costa cabral, who went into exile to madrid. that was the end of cabralism. despite all its shortcomings and corruption, in the end cabralism was a necessary stage in portuguese liberalism. costa cabral consolidated the liberal state, based on strong centralization and a complex bureaucracy. based on the army, freemasonry, of which costa cabral was grand master of the lusitanian grand orient, and clientele who benefited from the economic and financial policy, based on public works and development, cabralism laid the foundations of the current portuguese state, and many of its features have survived to the present day. references bibliography bonifácio, maria de fátima, história da guerra civil da patuleia 1846-1847, editorial estampa, lisboa, 1993 (isbn 9723309270) capela, josé viriato;

       " 'sometimes a great notion is the second novel by american author ken kesey, published in 1964. while one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest (1962) is more famous, many critics consider sometimes a great notion kesey\\'s magnum opus. the story involves an oregon family of gyppo loggers who cut trees for a local mill in opposition to unionized workers who are on strike. kesey took the title from the song \"goodnight, irene\", popularized by lead belly. sometimes i lives in the country sometimes i lives in the town sometimes i haves a great notion to jump into the river an\\' drown plot the story centers on the stamper family, a hard-headed logging clan in the coastal town of wakonda, on the oregon coast, in the early 1960s. the union loggers in wakonda go on strike to demand the same pay for shorter hours in response to the decreasing need for labor. the stampers, however, own and operate a small family business independent of the unions and decide to continue working to supply the regionally owned mill with all the timber the laborers would have supplied had the strike not occurred. the rest of the town is outraged. this decision and its surrounding details are examined alongside the complex histories, relationships, and rivalries of the members of the stamper family: henry stamper, the elderly, politically and socially conservative patriarch of the family, whose motto \"never give a inch!\" has defined the nature of the family and its dynamic with the rest of the town; hank, the older son of henry, whose indefatigable will and stubborn personality make him a natural leader but whose subtle insecurities threaten the stability of his family; leland, the younger son of henry and half-brother of hank, who as a child left wakonda for the east coast with his mother, but whose eccentric behavior and desire for revenge against hank lead him back to oregon when his mother dies; and viv, whose love for her husband hank fades as she realizes her subordinate place in the stamper household. the stamper house itself, on an isolated bank of the wakonda auga river, manifests the physical obstinacy of the stamper family. as the nearby river slowly widens and erodes the surrounding land, all the other houses on the river have either been consumed or wrecked by the waters or been rebuilt further from the bank, except the stamper house, which stands on a precarious peninsula struggling to maintain every inch of land with the help of an arsenal of boards, sandbags, cables, and other miscellaneous items brandished by henry stamper in his fight against the encroaching river. reception in the electric kool-aid acid test, tom wolfe, who had traveled with kesey and his companions on the bus furthur, noted that initial reviews of the book varied widely. commenting in the saturday review in a 1964 piece entitled \"beatnik in lumberjack country\", critic granville hicks wrote: \"in his first novel, one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest, ken kesey demonstrated that he was a forceful, inventive and ambitious writer. all of these qualities are exhibited, in even higher degree, in sometimes a great notion. here he has told a fascinating story in a fascinating way.\" also in the saturday review, john barkham wrote: \"a novelist of unusual talent and imagination ... a huge, turbulent tale ...\" in wolfe\\'s old paper, the new york herald tribune, maurice dolbier wrote: \"in the fiction wilderness, this is a towering redwood.\" in his introduction to the penguin edition, charles bowden called it \"one of the few essential books written by an american in the last half century.\" in 1997, a panel of writers from the pacific northwest voted it number one in a list of \"12 essential northwest works\". one critic described it as \"...what may well be the quintessential northwest novel\". wolfe and others compared it to william faulkner\\'s absalom, absalom! in both form and content. wolfe also noted, however, that time characterized it as \"a big novel—but that it was overwritten and had failed.\" adaptations in 1970, the novel was adapted into a film, which was retitled never give an inch for television. the film was directed by paul newman, who starred alongside henry fonda. it was nominated for two oscars. a stage adaptation, written and directed by aaron posner, premiered in portland, oregon, at portland center stage on april 4, 2008. references citations general and cited sources 1964 american novels american novels adapted into films american novels adapted into plays novels set in forests novels set in oregon viking press books works by ken kesey',\n",

       " 'corte de\\' frati (cremunés: ) is a municipality (comune) in the province of cremona, in the lombardy italian region. history the main history of corte de\\' frati is related to the establishment of the court of alfiano. in fact, the original name of the municipality was court of alfiano, a name referring to a patrician family who owned these lands. 10th century after the extinction of the carolingian and the saxon dynasty, the 10th century was the era of castles and fortress, and the population had to face wars provoked by the counts. from 950 to 1000, the bresciani and cremonesi counts fought among the lands of the river oglio, near bordolano and canneto, because the bresciani imposed taxes on the cremonesi\\'s lands. during this period, the castle of corte de\\' frati was born, but now it does not exist anymore. on 1004, henry ii conquered brescia and the court of alfiano belonged to the santa giulia monastery in brescia. 13th century during the 13th century, a bridge was built by the cremonesi people near grumone, a frazione of the nowadays corte de\\' frati, in order not to pay the toll bridge enforced by the bresciani on the bridge of pontevico. this new project gave life to a war between the two dynasties: in 1213 the bresciani ordered to the cremonesi that the bridge was to be destroyed because it was built on the brescian territory. the bridge, however, was not destroyed until 1228, when alfiano was assaulted by an armed conflict between bresciani and cremonesi, during which the majority of warriors died and those who survived were imprisoned. afterwards, the two dynasties did not resume their hostilities for a long time because in 1237 the territory was occupied by frederick ii, who used the contested bridge to move easily around cremonese territory. in the first half of the 13th century, under the pontificate of pope innocent iii, the italian religious order of humiliati was born and in 1246 they held the saint abbondio church in cremona. the humiliati also took possession of alfiano, whose name was transformed into corte de\\' frati. 14th century during the 14th century, the raids by the bresciani on the territory started again, and the cremonesi\\'s raids were mostly done in pontevico. the city of cremona strengthened the cities near the oglio river to avoid new conflicts. in 1324, louis iv reconfirmed to the cremonesi all the privileges and rights previously granted by their predecessors. this event led to new hostilities and disagreements with the bresciani. facing a rivalry that was never going to end, the archbishop of milan giovanni visconti issued a law stating that the toll fee of pontevico\\'s bridge was unmodifiable. 15th century the beginning of the 15th century faced a new armed conflict between the lord of brescia pandolfo malatesta, and the lord of cremona cabrino fondulo. pandolfo came to the cremonese territory with an army and took possession of robecco, alfiano, corte de\\' frati and other villages near the oglio river. in 1413 a peace treaty was signed and the cremonesi reclaimed their lands. at the end of the century, however, the republic of venice conquered brescia and cremona. 17th century after the suppression of the humiliati at the beginning of the 17th century, in 1614 the pope paul v ordered the establishment of the perpetual vicar. in this period the world was facing the bubonic plague, and in 1630 corte de\\' frati registered 253 deaths, which was a high number considering that the inhabitants were only 1,000. facing a high number of deaths, the parish decided to build a new cemetery, because the bodies used to be buried near to the church. in 1648, a trench called \"trincerone\" was built by the marquis caracena, governor of milan, to avoid the siege of cremona by the french. it started from cremona and ended in grumone, and it was 10 miles long. in the same year, however, the cremonesi managed to free the city from the french siege. the municipality of pontevico persisted with the toll bridge, and this inevitably led people coming from the cremonese territory to use the river from alfiano to avoid the tax fee. in april 1671 the city of brescia issued a proclamation suspending the use of the river as a way to avoid the pontevico\\'s bridge. in 1683 the present-day church of corte de\\' frati was built above the old castle\\'s foundation. 18th century at the beginning of the 18th century, the municipality was hit by a very high mortality rate of bovine animals. meanwhile, the lands of grumone, corte de\\' frati and robecco were continuously damaged by the raids. from 1777 to 1780 there was a high rate of famine, and the century ended again with an epizootic. 19th century the 19th century started with the french conquering cremona and its territories, and they also took refuge on corte de\\' frati for three months. in 1802 an earthquake hit the municipality and the church was damaged. during these period, thanks to napoleon, the streets were fixed and a postal service was activated. corte de\\' frati, alfiano, and aspice relied on the municipality of robecco. in 1816 there was a high rate of drought that led to famine, and the following year the petechial typhus was spreading through the peasants. this disease was probably caused by the previously mentioned famine, and the deaths were almost 150. in 1867 a cholera outbreak was registered once again. in the same year, the rail line cremona-brescia was built, and the river oglio lost his main function of trade exchange. economy the local economy is mostly based on agriculture and industrial activities. the territory is well known for its dairy farms and for its metal industry. food is related to the city of cremona, including salted meat, grana padano and different types of local fruits and vegetables coming from the local farms. transport corte de\\' frati is linked both to the city of cremona and to the city of

but my issues are sculptural, not musical. sculpture, in its most expanded sense, is the mode of experience that i find truest. i like to think about what an expanded sculptural experience could be: a full bodied bunch of sensation around being here, in the realm of the actual, the physical, in this multi-dimensional world. i\\'m trying to expand the sculptural experience by addressing, if not celebrating, our own existence as spatial, physical entities inhabiting all our dimensions. sculpture should be a category of experience, not just a category of physical objects for us to stand back and behold.\" brewster\\'s two major bodies of works are his acoustic sculptures and his sonic drawings. brewster describes these works as follows: \"a typical acoustic sculpture is a mix of electronic tones emitted into a bare room by a single loudspeaker. the sounds echoing through each other produce a field of sound populated by places of differing loudness and tonal content. to see an acoustic sculpture, we must shift our sculpture viewing habits from the \"stand and look\" behavior to an exploratory \"move and listen\" approach; slowly walking our ears, instead of moving our eyes, through the elaborate spaces of \"the room.\" \"a sonic drawing uses devices that emit sounds at intervals. this work relies on the coincidence of intervals to draw ‘holes\\' in the activity, producing moments when, through a union of all elements, nothing happens.\" brewster conceived of sonic drawings in the late 1960s while attending pomona college in claremont. he debuted them for his master of fine arts exhibition in 1969. this body of work has two forms: \"clickers\" and \"whistlers.\" clickers are hidden in the gallery walls while whistlers are visible, and require the gallery visitor to activate them. the clickers were exhibited in new york, dallas, and were collected by helene winer, pomona college, and merry norris, among others. the acoustic sculptures came from brewster\\'s study of sound waves. learning about the phenomenon of standing waves in the early 1970s, brewster constructed his first acoustic sculpture fixed frequency at f space (an artist-run space in santa ana) in 1971. originally, these pieces used one single tone. however, during the 1980s and 1990s, they became more complex. they began using multiple sounds and activation switches that give someone the ability to activate the piece thus making them participatory. these pieces generated scholarship by the sound theorist brandon labelle and are in the permanent collection of the moca la and the guggenheim in new york. selected exhibitions throughout his career, his work was exhibited at artists space, new york; galleria del cavallino, venice, italy; the marum overpass- kw ix a, groningen, the netherlands; moma ps1, new york; san francisco art institute and the southern california institute of architecture (sci-arc). michael brewster participated in the 1981 biennial at the whitney museum of american art in new york. that same year, he was a part of art in los angeles: the museum as site, sixteen projects at the los angeles county museum of art. the following year, he collaborated with mowry baden at the outdoor exhibition, artpark, in lewiston, new york. in 1985, he was a part of new music america, at the museum of contemporary art, los angeles; and cola, at barnsdall municipal gallery, los angeles in 1998. in 2002, \"‘see hear now:\\' a sonic drawing and five acoustic sculptures,\" a retrospective exhibition of brewster\\'s work was shown at los angeles contemporary exhibitions, and in 2012, he participated in \"it happened at pomona part 3: pacific standard time\", sponsored by the getty foundation at pomona college museum of art, claremont, ca. public collections brewster\\'s work is held in permanent public and private collections worldwide, including the solomon r. guggenheim museum, new york; fondo per l\\' ambiente italiano, varese, italy; museum of contemporary art, los angeles, california; orange county art museum, newport beach, california; san diego museum of contemporary art, la jolla, california; university gallery, amherst, massachusetts. recognition in april 1988, brewster was awarded the j. s. guggenheim memorial foundation fellowship. he was the recipient of the national endowment for the arts, artist\\'s fellowship grant in the years 1976, 1978, 1984, and 1990. in 1996, brewster received an individual artists grant from the los angeles cultural affairs department. references 1946 births 2016 deaths artists from eugene, oregon pomona college alumni claremont graduate university alumni claremont graduate university faculty 20th-century american artists american sound artists american multimedia artists',\n",

       " 'a powerplay is the name for the fielding restrictions in limited overs cricket. it was first introduced in 1980-81 australian season. fielding restrictions has been a rule in odi cricket since 1992. it was renamed as powerplay by icc in 2005. unlike test cricket, the fielders are spread out to save runs in limited overs cricket. the powerplay rules along with a number of other factors, has contributed to the big scores in modern one day internationals since 1992. rules one day international (odi) and twenty20 differ in terms of the number of overs where mandatory powerplay rules apply. the rules below apply only when a match is uninterrupted. odi during the first 10 overs of an innings, a maximum of two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle (27 metres). this is called the 1st powerplay. between overs 11 and 40, a maximum of four fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. in the final 10 overs (41-50), a maximum of five fielders will be allowed to field outside the 30-yard circle. twenty20 in most domestic leagues and international twenty20 cricket, the first six overs of an innings will be a mandatory powerplay, with only two fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle. beginning with the seventh over, no more than five fielders will be allowed outside the 30-yard circle. however, in the big bash league the powerplay is only the first 4 overs, with the batters choosing when the same restrictions apply for 2 overs in the second half of the innings, in a period called a powersurge. 100-ball cricket the powerplay restrictions are active during the first 25 legal balls of the innings, with only two fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle. history fielding restrictions evolved through the 1970s, notably in world series cricket, and were first introduced in odis in 1980 in australia. the most common rule was for only two fielders to be allowed outside the circle in the first fifteen overs, then five fielders allowed outside the circle for the remaining overs. the powerplay nomenclature was introduced by the international cricket council in 2005, when the fielding restrictions were split into 3 blocks: the mandatory ten overs at the start of the innings and two further five-over powerplays with the bowling team being able to choose the timing of both. in practice though, both were generally taken as soon as possible, effectively leading to a single block of 20 overs of fielding restrictions. to counter this, in 2008, the batting team was given discretion for the timing of one of the two powerplays. from 1 october 2011, the icc brought additional changes to the bowling and batting powerplays. under the new rules, in a 50-over match, neither of the two five-over powerplays may be taken before the start of the 16th over and both must be completed before the commencement of the 41st over, so overs 11 to 15 and 41 to 50 cannot be powerplay overs. should either or both teams choose not to exercise their discretion, their powerplay overs will automatically commence at the latest available point in the innings (e.g. in a 50-over innings with one unclaimed powerplay, it will begin at the start of the 36th over). on 29 october 2012, the icc made further amendments on powerplays, reducing the number of blocks of powerplays from three to two. from 1992 to 2012, during non-powerplay overs a total of five fielders were allowed outside the circle. this was changed to four in october 2012. moreover, from 1992 to 2005, two fielders were required in catching positions in the first fifteen overs. this was reduced to the first ten overs in july 2005. from 5 july 2015, the icc further amended the rules, making the whole innings as a composition of 3 powerplays, thus removing the batting powerplay previously introduced. furthermore, the restriction of two catching fielders on the first powerplay was relaxed. references cricket terminology',\n",

       " 'acoustic quieting is the process of making machinery quieter by damping vibrations to prevent them from reaching the observer. machinery vibrates, causing sound waves in air, hydroacoustic waves in water, and mechanical stresses in solid matter. quieting is achieved by absorbing the vibrational energy or minimizing the source of the vibration. it may also be redirected away from the observer. one of the major reasons for the development of acoustic quieting techniques was for making submarines difficult to detect by sonar. this military goal of the mid- and late-twentieth century allowed the technology to be adapted to many industries and products, such as computers (e.g. hard drive technology), automobiles (e.g. motor mounts), and even sporting goods (e.g. golf clubs). aspects of acoustic quieting when the goal is acoustic quieting, a number of different aspects might be considered. each aspect of acoustics can be taken alone or in concert so that the end result is that the reception of noise by the observer is minimized. acoustic quieting might consider... noise generation: by limiting the noise at its source, sympathetic vibrations: by acoustic decoupling, resonations: by acoustic damping or changing the size of the resonator, sound transmissions: by reducing transmission using many methods (depending whether the transmission is through air, liquid, or solid), or sound reflections: by limiting the reflection using many methods, e.g. by using acoustic absorption (deadening) materials, trapping the sound, opening a \"window\" to let sound out, etc. by analyzing the entire sequence of events, from the source to the observer, an acoustic engineer can provide many ways to quieten the machine. the challenge is to do this in a practical and inexpensive way. the engineer might focus on changing materials, using a damping material, isolating the machine, running the machine in a vacuum, or running the machine slower. methods of quieting mechanical acoustic quieting sound isolation: noise isolation is isolating noise to prevent it from transferring out of one area, using barriers like deadening materials to trap sound and vibrational energy. example: in home and office construction, many builders place sound-control barriers (such as fiberglass batting) in walls to deaden the transmission of noise through them. noise absorption: in architectural acoustics, unwanted sounds can be absorbed rather than reflected inside the room of an observer. this is useful for noises with no point source and when a listener needs to hear sounds only from a point source and not echo reflections. example: in a recording studio, sound proofing is accomplished with bass traps and anechoic chambers. wallace sabine, an american physicist, is credited with studying sound reverberations in 1900, and carl eyring revised his equations in 1930 for bell labs. another example is the ubiquitous use of dropped ceilings and acoustical tiles in modern office buildings with high ceilings. submarine hulls have special coatings that absorb sound. acoustic damping: vibration isolation prevents vibration from transferring beyond the device into another material. damping mounts have progressed in the industry to offer vibrational resistance in many degrees of freedom. recent advances include shock isolators damping in at least six degrees of freedom. acoustic damping also has uses in seismic shock protection of buildings. motors and rotating shafts are commonly fitted with these mounts at the points where they contact the building or the chassis of a large machine. acoustic decoupling: certain parts of a machine can be built to keep the frame, chassis, or external shafts from receiving unwanted vibrations from a moving part. example: volkswagen has registered a patent for an \"acoustically decoupled underbody for a motor vehicle.\". another example: western digital has registered a patent for an \"acoustic vibration decoupler for a disk drive pivot bearing assembly.\". preventing stalls: whenever a machine undergoes an aerodynamic stall, it will abruptly vibrate. preventing cavitation: when a machine is in contact with a fluid, it may be susceptible to cavitation. the sounds of gas bubbles imploding is the source of the noise. ships and submarines which have screws that cavitate are more vulnerable to detection by sonar. preventing water hammer: in hydraulics and plumbing, water hammer is a known cause for the failure of piping systems. it also generates considerable noise. a valve that abruptly opens or shuts is the most common cause for water hammer. shock absorption: just as automotive shock absorbers are used to prevent mechanical shocks from reaching the passengers in a car, they are also important for quieting shocks. reduction of resonance: essentially any piece of metal or glass has certain frequencies to which it is susceptible to resonate. a machine that resonates would make a tremendous noise. resonance also occurs in enclosures, such as when echoes reverberate in an ocarina or the pipe of a pipe organ. material selection: by choosing nonmetallic components, the transmission of sound and vibrations can be minimized. for example: instead of using rigid brass fittings, a machine using flexible plastic pipe fittings may be much quieter. in some cases air can be evacuated from a machine and sealed hermetically, the vacuum inside becoming a barrier to sound transmission. in cases where porous plastic materials are used in acoustic applications, the porosity of the plastic is adjusted to either dampen specific wavelengths or for minimal sound loss in a speaker grill cover. quieting for specific observers underwater acoustics: all of the above types of acoustic quieting apply to submarines. additionally, a submarine may employ a tactic that prevent sounds from reaching a listener at a particular ocean depth. operating below the depth of the sound channel axis, where the speed of sound in water is the lowest, a submarine can prevent detection by surface ships, unless these ships use equipment like a towed array and/or an underwater drone to place hydrophones below the sound channel axis. sound refraction: just as a submarine can use refraction to hide its acoustic signature from surface vessels, the same principle of sound refraction can be used to prevent certain observers from hearing the noise. for example, an outdoor observer close to the ground will have sound waves refracted toward him when the ground is cooler than the ambient air and away from him when the ground is hotter than the air. sound redirection: one of the obvious ways to reduce the received sound level of an observer is to place the observer out of the path of the highest amplitude sounds. for example, if we mark off a circle around a jet engine and make sound power level observations along that circle, we would expect that the sound is loudest directly in line with the jet\\'s exhaust. observations perpendicular to the exhaust would be significantly quieter. hearing protection: an observer may be forced to wear ear plugs in areas of high ambient noise levels. this may be the only quieting method available in areas of noise pollution, such as an open-air firing range or an airport. electronic quieting electronic vibration control: electronics, sensors, and computers are now employed to reduce vibration. using high speed logic, vibrations can be damped quickly and effectively by counteracting the motion before it exceeds a certain threshold. electronic noise control: electronics, sensors, and computers are also employed to cancel noise by using phase cancellation which matches the sound amplitude with a wave of the opposite polarity. this method employs the use of an active sound generating device, such as a loudspeaker to counteract ambient noise in an area. see noise-canceling headphone. workers in noisy environments may favor this method over ear plugs. noise reduction: in sound and video equipment, noise reduction is the process of removing noise from a signal. this is strictly for electronic noise or noise which has been detected and put into electronic form. noise canceling: if both the noise and the signal are received by an electronic or digital medium, noise can be filtered from the signal electronically and retransmitted without the noise. see noise-canceling microphone. helicopter pilots rely on this technology to speak on the radio. see also acoustic signature noise reduction, for electronic noise sound masking, for noise

       " 'tornel or hulera tornel is a mexican enterprise and only surviving mexican tire manufacturer in mexico, dedicated to making tires and other automotive industry-related products. founded in 1933 by mexican businessman armando tornel, who in october 2006 entered the worldwide tire industry hall of fame. hulera tornel is the top latin american tire manufacturer, and one of the largest tire manufacturers currently active in the world. history compañía hulera tornel is a mexican tire manufacturer currently part of jk tyre group of india. compañía hulera tornel was originally founded by the tornel family, one of the oldest families in mexico, renown in the mexican industry and society. the company was founded by isauro tornel toriz and his eldest son, armando tornel murillo, native from el salto de juanacatlán, jalisco, mexico. armando entered the tire business when he was only 15 years old, while working as a tire seller at the same time he was studying in the night school of san indelfonso in mexico city. years later, his father mr. isauro tornel toriz decided to send armando to the united states, where he pursued a technical career in tire engineering at smithers laboratories, and rubber technology at vanderbilt laboratories, gaining technical and practical experience at goodyear and mohawk, both in akron, ohio. upon armando´s return to mexico during 1933, he partnered with his father and his younger brothers salvador and raúl, and together they opened a tire-sale business with 27 employees, at a store located at hidalgo avenue number 91, in the historic downtown area of mexico city. in 1937, the tornel family business was formalized via incorporation of compañía hulera el centenario, company that manufactures and marketed at the time tires under the america and all states brands. in 1940 the tornel family associated with firestone through a joint venture, changing the name of the company to \"cía. hulera firestone centenario\". some years later, the tornel family decided to sell their stock to firestone, and independently pursued continuity in the tire business on their own by incorporating the wholly owned compañía hulera tornel (tornel rubber company), manufacturing tires as well as rubber and supplies for tire repair. under compañía hulera tornel, armando assumed the position of chair of the company\\'s board, while his brothers raul and salvador occupied other key positions as senior members of the company\\'s board of directors until their deaths. in the 1950s compañía hulera tornel entered other sectors and started manufacturing bicycle tubes and also devised new manufacturing techniques. in 1968 it expanded to manufacturing bicycle tires as well. compañía hulera tornel remained in the tornel family for 4 generations. development, consolidation and sale to the jk group in the 1970s the company started to grow dramatically within the closed economy then existing in mexico, and also began to compete with other national tire companies like general popo, euzkadi, and the oldest of all, hercules. at this time compañía hulera tornel began to launch most of its modern products such as the tire tubes manufactured with point technology and dabbled in making tires for trucks and buses. the 1980s brought a crisis to the mexican economy due to devaluations that caused the closing of tornel\\'s competitors: general popo, euzkadi and hercules. when the company saw these closings, they paid attention and steered the business toward specializing in the retail vehicle and truck sales niche. this move allowed them to adapt and later thrive in the market. the closing of these competitor factories allowed tornel free rein in the market but not for long since soon after competition began from foreign tire manufacturers which would turn out to be aggressive commercial rivals, such as goodyear, bridgestone, michelin, firestone, and bfgoodrich. however, despite the incursion of foreign companies, the market position and tornel prestige was not diminished. after four generations of members of the tornel family running the company, in 2008 compañía hulera tornel was acquired by jk tyre of india. today in may 2008, tornel was purchased by india-based jk tyre for $68 million. jk tyre is an indian tyre manufacturer that is about the 23rd largest in the world. it intends to use tornel as the base for its approach to the north american market taking advantage of the nafta, and is investing in molds to manufacture tires under both the tornel and jk brands. tornel has a total of three manufacturing facilities, all within the metropolitan area of mexico city. before the sale of the company, the tornel family assisted to the ceremony in las vegas, nevada where armando tornel was granted a place in the tire industry association hall of fame in october 2006. references external links official site tire manufacturers of mexico mexican brands manufacturing companies established in 1933 mexican companies established in 1933',\n",
       " 'in the district of columbia, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (lgbt) people enjoy the same rights as non-lgbt people. along with the rest of the country, the district of columbia recognizes and allows same-sex marriages. the percentage of same-sex households in the district of columbia in 2008 was at 1.8%, the highest in the nation. this number had grown to 4.2% by early 2015. the district of columbia is regarded as very accepting and tolerant of lgbt people and same-sex relationships, with a 2017 public religion research institute poll indicating that 78% of residents supported same-sex marriage. the district also explicitly bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and the use of conversion therapy on both minors and adults. same-sex marriage legislation came into effect in march 2010, granting same-sex couples the right to marry, while domestic partnerships were legalized in 2002. legality of same-sex sexual activity recognition of same-sex relationships same-sex domestic partnerships were legalized by the council in 1992 through the health benefits expansion act, but the republican-controlled congress refused to approve the measure until 2002, when a legislative rider preventing congressional approval of the act\\'s implementation was not included that year. afterwards, the domestic partnership provisions of district law were incrementally expanded. same-sex marriage in the district of columbia was legalized on december 18, 2009, when mayor adrian fenty signed a bill passed by the council of the district of columbia on december 15, 2009. following the signing, the measure entered a mandatory congressional review of 30 work days. marriage licenses became available on march 3, 2010, and marriages began on march 9. the district became the only jurisdiction in the united states below the mason-dixon line to allow same-sex couples to marry, until neighboring maryland legalized same-sex marriage on january 1, 2013. domestic partnerships for same-sex and opposite-sex couples remain available as an option alongside marriage. the district has provided benefits to same-sex partners of state employees since 2002. adoption and family planning same-sex couples are allowed to legally adopt children. additionally, lesbian couples have access to in vitro fertilization (the non-gestational, non-genetic parent is automatically recognized as a legal parent of a child born via donor insemination), and gay couples are permitted to undertake gestational and traditional surrogacy arrangements under the same terms and conditions as different-sex couples. on december 2, 2016, a legislative committee passed a bill, in a 9-0 vote, to allow commercial surrogacy contracts for all couples. on december 22, the council of the district of columbia passed the bill in its second reading unanimously by a vote of 13-0. mayor muriel bowser signed the bill into law on february 15, 2017, and it went into effect on april 7, 2017, after the 30-day congressional review had passed. discrimination protections in the d.c. human rights act, sexual identity and gender identity and expression are among its defined protected traits. discrimination against these traits is illegal in housing, in employment, in public accommodations, and in educational institutions. in 1973, the d.c. government passed title 34, an expansive human rights law that prohibited discrimination against many protected traits, which included sexual orientation. the city became among the first in the united states to offer discrimination protections to lgbt people. the law was incorporated into the d.c. human rights act in 1977. in 1989, congress passed an amendment to the human rights act, named after senator william l. armstrong, that permitted religious schools to discriminate against students based on sexual orientation. the d.c. government successfully repealed the armstrong amendment in 2015. the act was also amended in 2006 to include gender identity and gender expression as protected traits. in june 2012, the d.c. government passed the youth bullying prevention act, which requires businesses serving youth to have clear anti-bullying policies. the law specifically adds protections for bullying of lgbt youth and children of lgbt parents. it went into effect in september. in late 2020, the d.c. government passed a law that amended the d.c. human rights act to add discrimination protections for lgbt seniors and seniors living with hiv in long-term care facilities. the law went into effect in january 2021. hate crime law the district\\'s hate crime law covers both sexual orientation and gender identity. it provides additional penalties for crimes motivated by the victim\\'s sexual orientation or gender identity, amongst other categories. gay panic defense the gay panic defense, a controversial legal strategy that claims a victim\\'s sexual orientation or gender identity and/or expression is to blame for a defendant\\'s violence, including murder, has been illegal in the district of columbia since may 2021. at the time of passage, eleven other states had already banned the defense. in september 2019, members of the d.c. council introduced two bills to alter the city code by abolishing the gay panic defense. the bills used the term \"heat of passion\" to describe the panic defense. the bills were referred to the council\\'s judiciary and public safety committee to be merged and by november 2020, the committee advanced the resulting bill to the full council. named the \"bella evangelista and tony hunter panic defense prohibition and hate crimes response amendment act of 2020\", it is named after two lgbt people who were killed in the district. bella evangelista was a trans woman who was shot and killed by a 22-year-old man in 2003; tony hunter was a gay man who was killed during an assault by an 20-year-old man in 2008. the men charged in the two cases attempted to use the gay panic defense. the council unanimously passed the bill in december, and mayor muriel bowser signed the bill in january 2021. it was reported in january that the government might lack the necessary funds to fully implement the law. the associated press reported in february that the attack on the u.s. capitol had delayed several pieces of legislation from taking effect, including the law abolishing the gay panic defense. after many delays, the law went into effect in may 2021. civil litigation and other reforms the district of columbia has a pending law that would ban a judge or jury from devaluing personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, among other protected classes. the \"stormiyah denson-jackson economic damages equity act of 2022\" was named after a 12-year-old black girl who committed suicide at a d.c. boarding school and whose wrongful death lawsuit was devalued. it was passed by the d.c. council in october 2022 and signed by mayor muriel bowser in november. transgender rights gender on identity documents on identity documents issued by the district of columbia, transgender people can amend the gender marker to reflect their correct gender identity, and they do not need to undergo gender-affirming surgery to do so. nonbinary people can amend the gender marker on their driver\\'s license to the third gender option \"x\", but not for other identity documents. in 2013, the d.c. government enacted the japarker deoni jones birth certificate equality amendment act of 2013, which allows d.c. residents to obtain a new birth certificate reflecting their gender identity so long as they provide a letter from a licensed health care provider certifying the resident\\'s change in gender identity. it repealed an existing provision that required the resident to undergo gender-affirming surgery. the law was named after japarker deoni jones, a trans woman

transgender people. in 2016, the d.c. government unanimously approved the \"death certificate gender identity recognition amendment act of 2016\", a law that was proposed the year before but failed, which allows a transgender person\\'s gender identity to be properly recorded on their death certificate. it went into effect in april 2017. in june 2017, the d.c. department of motor vehicles began offering a third gender option on driver\\'s licenses and identification cards: \"x\". whitman-walker health (wwh) and the national center for transgender equality (ncte) helped lead the initiative. the department issued the first-ever gender-neutral identification card in the united states to shige sakurai, an lgbt rights activist who drove wwh and the ncte to lead the initiative. in september 2018, the d.c. government unanimously approved the nonbinary identification cards amendment act of 2017, which codified the department\\'s decision into law. the bill did not specify that the \"x\" option is available for birth certificates. prison before june 2021, the d.c. department of corrections housed transgender inmates in the men\\'s or women\\'s sections of the d.c. jail based on their

discrimination lawsuit against the policy. she was quickly transferred to a women\\'s cell and the department of corrections adopted a new policy. it stated that the department will house \"transgender, intersex, or gender nonconforming inmates in male or female units based on their preference\". the department also agreed to limit the time the inmates are held in solitary confinement prior to receiving their assignment. other reforms in november 2022, a bill was signed into law by the mayor subject to a 30 day congressional review (that passed the dc council unanimously 13-0)

and immunity to prosecution by other jurisdictions outside of dc with anti-gay, anti-transgender and anti-abortion policies towards individuals by law enforcement\". california has similar legislation

orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to align with heterosexual and cisgender norms, is illegal in the district of columbia since the 2010s. it was made illegal for minors in 2015 and for adults in 2019. in december 2014, the d.c. government unanimously approved a ban on conversion therapy on minors. despite pressure from groups that oppose lgbt rights, congress did not introduce legislation overturning or blocking the bill. d.c. became the third u.s. jurisdictionbehind california and new jerseyto enact a ban. the bill went into effect in march 2015. in january 2019, the d.c. government extended conversion therapy ban to adults in a unanimous decision, specifically those that are not allowed to make their own medical decisions. mary cheh, the author of both bans, reported that the original ban had to be extended to adults that are not permitted or unable to make their own medical decisions. the bill went into effect in march 2019. it was the first of its kind to ban conversion therapy for adults, making the city\\'s conversion therapy bans the most comprehensive in the united states. blood and tissue donation public opinion and demographics a 2013 williams institute survey showed that 10% of the d.c. adult population identified as lgbt. this was the highest in the united states. a 2017 public religion research institute poll found that 78% of d.c.

the university of sydney had been established a mere ten years prior and public education was in its infancy. the school began to take in blind students in 1869, and added the word \"blind\" to its name. it was predominantly a boarding school, and moved many times within central sydney to accommodate more students as the school grew, including stints in paddington and newtown, before finding its present home in north rocks in 1962. it currently operates several educational centres on new south wales and offers some national services. david hunter, a former student of the school who had been blind from age 6, was elected as member of the nsw parliament (for ashfield) when he was 35 and served there for 35 years (1940-1976). he was responsible for the passing of an act in 1944 to make the education of blind and deaf children compulsory. another well-known student was alice betteridge, the first australian deafblind child to receive an education. she enrolled in 1908 at the age of seven where she learned to read and write, graduating as dux in 1920. schools within ridbc today there are three specialist schools within ridbc: the ridbc alice betteridge school, for children with sensory and intellectual disabilities (renamed from \"the special school for multi-handicapped blind students\" in 1990). the ridbc garfield barwick school, for \"oral\" deaf children who communicate using speech and assisted hearing. opened in 1988 as a primary school to prepare deaf students for a mainstream high school. the ridbc thomas pattison school, which provides education in auslan, australia\\'s deaf sign language. established in 1992 as the \"thomas pattison annexe\", renamed as a school in 1997. children\\'s services that ridbc provide ridbc also runs a number of early childhood services. these include home based, centre based and remote early education programs for children up to 5 years who have sensory disabilities, as well as five special preschools (ridbc hunter preschool, ridbc nepean preschool, ridbc visioned preschool, ridbc roberta reid preschool, ridbc rockie woofit preschool) and support for children with sensory disabilities enrolled in mainstream preschools. in 1997 ridbc was pleased to announce a new program known as ridbc teleschool, which combines the existing remote early learning programs for vision impairment and hearing impairment. in addition to its direct services, ridbc aims to help as many deaf and blind children as possible through its ridbc renwick centre, for research and professional education of those educating children with sensory disability. the ridbc renwick centre is conducted in conjunction with the macquarie university and offers a range of post-graduate courses (including a master of special education in sensory disability) and continuing education activities. the ridbc renwick centre attracts students from across australia and internationally. community support ridbc is a major australian charity but relies heavily on government subsidy and community support to continue its services. in 2010, ridbc celebrated its 150th anniversary. ambassadors reuben mourad - australian tv personality, former national anchor, and weather presenter michael parkinson - english broadcaster, journalist, author, and chat show legend tara moss - former model and international best-selling author graham ross - host of tv gardening show better homes & gardens and radio presenter on 2gb justin norris - australian olympic swimmer (butterfly and individual medley) names 1860 - deaf and dumb institution of new south wales 1868 - new south wales deaf and dumb institution 1869 - new south wales deaf dumb and blind institution 1957 - royal nsw institution for deaf and blind children 1962 - the institution provides the premises for two state schools operated by the nsw department of education: north rocks school for deaf children and north rocks school for blind children 1974 - royal nsw institute for deaf and blind children. 1997 - royal institute for deaf and blind children. see also deaf education blindness and education notes and references further reading crickmore, barbara lee (2000), an historical perspective on the academic education of deaf children in new south wales 1860s-1990s, phd thesis, university of newcastle. available for download. external links [https:// www.nextsense.org.au] nextsense website] blindness organisations in australia public schools in sydney schools for the deaf in australia special schools in australia the hills shire 1860 establishments in australia educational institutions established in 1860',\n",

       " 'leonard mcnally or macnally (27 september 1752 - 13 february 1820) was an irish barrister, playwright, lyricist, founding member of the united irishmen and spy for the british government within irish republican circles. he was a successful lawyer in late 18th and early 19th century dublin, and wrote a law book that was crucial in the development of the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard in criminal trials. however, during his time, he was best known for his popular comic operas and plays, together with his most enduring work, the romantic song \"the lass of richmond hill\". he is now mainly remembered as a very important informer for the british government within the irish revolutionary society, the united irishmen and played a major role in the defeat of the irish rebellion of 1798. in return for payments from the government, mcnally would betray his united irishmen colleagues to the authorities and then, as defence counsel at their trial, secretly collaborate with the prosecution to secure a conviction. his notable republican clients included napper tandy, wolfe tone, robert emmet and lord edward fitzgerald. early life mcnally was born in dublin in 1752, the son of a merchant and wine importer. he was raised by his mother with the support of his uncle. mcnally was born into a roman catholic family, but at some point in the 1760s he converted to the church of ireland. he was passionate about theatre, entirely self-educated and initially became a merchant in bordeaux like his father. however, in 1774 he went to london to study law at the middle temple but returned to dublin to be called to the irish bar in 1776. after returning to london in the late 1770s he qualified as a barrister in england, as well, in 1783. he practised for a short time in london, and, while there, supplemented his income by writing plays and editing the public ledger. career radical lawyer returning to ireland, mcnally developed a successful career as a barrister in dublin. he developed an expertise in the law of evidence and, in 1802, published what became a much-used textbook, the rules of evidence on pleas of the crown. the text played a crucial role in defining and publicising the beyond reasonable doubt standard for criminal trials. not long after returning to ireland, he became involved in radical politics, having already, in 1782, published a pamphlet in support of the irish cause. he became dublin\\'s leading radical lawyer of the day. in 1792, he represented napper tandy, a radical member of the irish parliament, in a legal dispute over parliamentary privilege. in the early 1790s, mcnally became a founder member of the united irishmen, a clandestine society which soon developed into a revolutionary irish republican organisation. he ranked high in its leadership and acted as the organisation\\'s chief lawyer, representing many united irishmen in court. this included defending wolfe tone and robert emmet, the leaders of the 1798 and 1803 rebellions respectively, at their trials for treason. in 1793, mcnally was wounded in a duel with sir jonah barrington, who had insulted the united irishmen. barrington subsequently described mcnally as \"a good-natured, hospitable, talented and dirty fellow\". john o\\'keeffe described mcnally as having \"a handsome, expressive countenance and alive sparkling eyes\". informer and government agent after his death in 1820, it emerged that mcnally had for many years been an informant for the government, and one of the most successful british spies in irish republican circles that there has ever been. when, in 1794, a united irishmen plot to seek aid from revolutionary france was uncovered by the british government, mcnally turned informer to save himself, although, subsequently, he also received payment for his services. mcnally was paid an annual pension in respect of his work as an informer of £300 a year, from 1794 until his death in 1820. from 1794, mcnally systematically informed on his united irishmen colleagues, who often gathered at his house for meetings. it was mcnally that betrayed lord edward fitzgerald, one of the leaders of the 1798 rebellion, as well as robert emmet in 1803. a significant factor in the failure of the 1798 rebellion was the efficacious intelligence provided to the government by its agents. mcnally was considered to be one of the most damaging informers. the united irishmen represented by mcnally at their trials were invariably convicted and mcnally was paid by the crown for passing the secrets of their defence to the prosecution. during the trial of emmet, mcnally provided details of the defence\\'s strategy to the crown and conducted his client\\'s case in a way that would assist the prosecution. for example, three days before the trial he assured the authorities that emmet \"does not intend to call a single witness, nor to trouble any witness for the crown with a cross-examination, unless they misrepresent facts… he will not controvert the charge by calling a single witness\". for his assistance to the prosecution in emmet\\'s case, he was paid a bonus of £200, on top of his pension, half of which was paid five days before the trial. after mcnally\\'s death, his activities as a government agent became generally known when his heir attempted to continue to collect his pension of £300 per year. he is still remembered with opprobrium by irish nationalists. in 1997, the sinn féin newspaper, an phoblacht in an article on mcnally, described him as \"undoubtedly one of the most treacherous informers of irish history\". playwright and lyricist mcnally was a successful dramatist and wrote a number of well-constructed but derivative comedies, as well as comic operas. his first dramatic work was the ruling passion, a comic opera written in 1771, and he is known to have authored at least twelve plays between 1779 and 1796 as well as other comic operas. his works include the apotheosis of punch (1779), a satire on the irish playwright richard brinsley sheridan, tristram shandy (1783), which was an adaptation of lawrence sterne\\'s novel, robin hood (1784), fashionable levities (1785), richard cœur de lion (1786), and critic upon critic (1788). he also wrote a number of songs and operettas for covent garden. one of his songs, sweet lass of richmond hill, became very well-known and popular following its first public performance at vauxhall gardens in london in 1789. it was said to be a favourite of george iii and popularised the romantic metaphor \"a rose without a thorn\", a phrase which mcnally had used in the song. personal life and family nothing is known of mcnally\\'s first wife mary o\\'brien, other than that she died in 1786. in london in 1787, mcnally eloped with frances i\\'anson, as her father william i\\'anson a solicitor, disapproved of mcnally. frances, and her family\\'s estate, hill house in richmond, yorkshire, was the subject of a song with lyrics by mcnally and composed by james hook, sweet lass of richmond hill. in 1795, frances died during child birth at age 29 and was survived by only one daughter. in 1799, mcnally married his third wife louisa edgeworth, the daughter of a clergyman from county longford, and with his third wife he had at least three sons. when his son, who had the same professions, died on 13 february 1820, it was widely reported to have been mcnally. the son was buried in donnybrook, dublin on 17 february 1820, and mcnally sent a letter on 6 march 1820 (from 20 cuffe street, dublin) to the proprietor of \\'saunders\\'s newsletter\\' seeking damages for the severe injury caused by the circulation of his death. in june 1820, mcnally was on his deathbed, and although he had been a protestant for most of his adult life, he sought absolution from a roman catholic priest, and was also buried in donnybrook on 8 june 1820. references bibliography the most extensive modern study on mcnally is: see also

       " 'ethical living is the philosophy of making decisions for daily life which take into account ethics and moral values, particularly with regard to consumerism, sustainability, environmentalism, wildlife and animal welfare. practice and implementation at present, it is largely an individual choice rather than an organized social movement. ethical living is an offshoot of sustainable living in which the individual initially makes a series of small lifestyle changes in order to limit their effect on the environment. making the decision to start to live ethically can be as easy as beginning to recycle, switching off lights when leaving a room, buying local organic or fair trade produce, or eating less meat. many people often go further by re-using/re-cycling waste water, using renewable resources in their homes such as solar panels or atmospheric water generators, or replacing driving with greener modes of transport such as biking. many, however, believe that even more drastic lifestyle changes need to be made in order to combat climate change. for example, the impending increase in our world\\'s population will likely exacerbate resource scarcity and increase carbon emissions. for this reason, many believe that ethical living could mean taking control of one\\'s reproductive health and \"requires social solutions such as increasing women\\'s empowerment in public and private life, and broadening the population movement beyond the family planning and reproductive health movements in order to raise its chances of success.\" national and international policies as maxwell t. boykoff, an assistant professor in the cooperative institute for research in environmental sciences center for science and technology policy research at the university of colorado, boulder argues, \"initiatives and plans that were formerly confined to the climate-controlled quarters of high-level policy briefing rooms and scientific conference halls are increasingly prevalent around the kitchen table, bar stool, front porch and corner shop\" making ethical patterns of consumption influential on domestic and international policies. for example, there are many governments, such as the netherlands, that strive to create a \"climate neutral society\" focused on \"trend breaks in technology, policy instruments, industrial, transport and agricultural practices, residential designs, and societal behavior\". while there are many calculators and venues with which to measure overall national and state level \"ecological footprints\", measurements for individual and community footprints are more difficult to measure. for this reason, the impacts of individual ethical living choices or \"green living\" can be inconclusive. some researchers question the amount of carbon footprint reduction that can be achieved through \"pro-environmental\" behavior as surveys have found that \"no significant difference was found between the ecological footprints of the two groups - suggesting that individual pro-environmental attitudes and behaviour do not always reduce the environmental impacts of consumption.\" this phenomenon has led to a new proposition known as the \"behavior-impact gap (big) problem\" where researchers realize that there may not always be a proportional relationship between changing lifestyle habits and a decrease in one\\'s carbon footprints. critiques although ethical living is growing in popularity, many in the environmental movement believe that the responsibility of ethical practice should also be placed on \"big business\". they argue that while individuals can change their daily habits, the most significant changes can and should be made by large organizations and multinational corporations. many criticize this argument, however, as they claim large organizations and multinational corporations increase consumption and perpetuate neoliberal and capitalistic tendencies leading to a loss of focus on \"liveable wages, affordable health care, decent education, breathable air, and clean water.\" another criticism of the ethical living movement is many individual consumption changes need to be made, however, \"it will take more than a well-intentioned review of individual shopping habits to address our present ecological crisis.\" see also effective altruism ethical consumerism fairtrade labelling simple living sustainable living intentional living personal life references further reading environmentalism intentional living',\n",

       " 'dieter senghaas (born 27 august 1940 in geislingen an der steige) is a german social scientist and peace researcher. biography after studying political science, social science, philosophy and history from 1960 to 1967, senghaas received his doctorate in frankfurt in 1967. his dissertation, kritik der abschreckung (criticism of deterrence), dealt with the field which has characterised his scientific activities since then: international relations, especially peace research, research on developing countries and conflict research. his studies were followed by work as an assistant at the johann wolfgang goethe university in frankfurt until 1968, and then a research residency in the usa with karl w. deutsch at harvard university, among others, until 1970. from 1972 until 1978, senghaas was leader of a research group at the hessische stiftung friedens- und konfliktforschung (hessian foundation for peace and conflict research) and professor at the university of frankfurt during that same period. since 1978, he has been a professor at the university of bremen and also active there at the institut für interkulturelle und internationale studien (institute for intercultural and international studies). in 1986/1987 and 1992/1994, dieter senghaas was a research professor at the stiftung wissenschaft und politik (foundation of science and politics). since 1995, senghaas has been a member of the advisory council of the bundesakademie für sicherheitspolitik (federal academy for security policies) in bonn. in 1999, senghaas was awarded the göttinger friedenspreis (göttingen peace prize) of the dr. roland röhl foundation. scientific work work concerning the east-west conflict in the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, senghaas took a close look at the armament dynamics and the system of deterrence in the east-west conflict. senghaas recognised an autistic structure in the deterrence situation of the cold war, which according to senghaas, was mostly driven from the inside and less from the outside (international processes). senghaas\\' criticism of deterrence and his analysis of armament dynamics and control contributed to the development of critical peace research. work concerning the north-south conflict in his three compilations, \"imperialismus und strukturelle gewalt (1972)\" (imperialism and structural power), \"peripherer kapitalismus. analysen über abhängigkeit und unterentwicklung (1974)\" (peripheral capitalism. analyses of dependency and underdevelopment) and \"kapitalistische weltökonomie. kontroversen über ihren ursprung und ihre entwicklungsdynamik (1979)\" (capitalistic world economy. controversies about its origin and its development dynamics), as well as in his 1977 book, \"weltwirtschaftsordnung und entwicklungspolitik. plädoyer für dissoziation\" (world economic order and development policy. plea for dissociation), senghaas attempts to make visible the structural dependency of the periphery on the metropolises, or stated more simply, the dependence of the developing countries (or areas) on the political and economic power centers in the age of world economy. senghaas sees a solution to the impediments to development, created externally (pressure of the industrial countries) and internally (interests of the power elite in keeping the existing societal structures), in a decoupling (not severance!) at times from the world market. in this decoupling phase, the concentration should be upon the development of the economic form of the developing countries, which should be the satisfaction of the local population, if possible exploiting local resources (with which senghaas does not mean striving for economic self-sufficiency). with this way of looking at things, senghaas also simultaneously rejected the idea prevalent at that time that simply integrating the third world into the existing world economic order could solve the development problems of the third world. as of the middle of the 1970s, senghaas attempted to strengthen his theory by analysing the developing socialist countries of albania, the people\\'s republic of china, north korea and cuba. for senghaas, socialism did not represent a post-capitalist production system. much more (independently of the intentions of the respective leader or regime), socialism could accomplish an economic development, which would not have been possible in that way under capitalistic conditions. in his analysis, senghaas came to the conclusion that the development of states proceeded positively in the beginning, but then came increasingly to a standstill due to the absence of reforms, a more and more complex system of business and society and an increasingly inflexible political order (results in the middle of the 1980s). from the results of the analysis, several country monographs and an article on the status of socialism regarding historical development were created in cooperations with frankfurt graduate students. dieter senghaas decisively left his mark on the discussion of theoretical development within international relations in germany with his works about the possibilities of independent development processes in dependency of the given international conditions (economic and political). the civilizational hexagon dieter senghaas\\' \"civilizational hexagon\" joins load-bearing building blocks together for a stable maintenance of peace. this peacekeeping and its supervision of itself is regarded as a civilising project. the hexagon consists of six building blocks, which are all linked to each other, since they all depend on each other. a fundamental building block is the monopoly on the use of force, which means the de-privatisation of force and its authorization, that is, \"disarmament of the citizens\". the next building block, the rule of law, comprises the control of the monopoly of force, which has as a precondition that the public monopoly of force is not despotically abused. since without a check on the monopoly of force, it would be nothing less than a dictatorship. the third building block, democratic participation, means democratic involvement of the public in elections and other decision making, since without this right of the people to contribute, they would not obey the professed laws. the trust of the people must also be secured by equal rights, so that they comply with such regulations. this occurs, among other things, through the building block of social justice, which provides for a just verdict from a neutral court when there is a violation of the law, but also takes care of safeguarding the basic necessities of every person. the next building block falls under the heading of constructive conflict culture, which describes the capability for tolerance in a multi-cultural society and a willingness for compromise-oriented conflict solution. the last building block of the hexagon is interdependencies and control of emotion. the purpose of this building block is the mutual dependency among people and their control of themselves in conflict situations. publications abschreckung und frieden. studien zur

       " 'space quest 6: roger wilco in the spinal frontier is a point-and-click adventure game developed and published by sierra on-line in 1995. it is the sixth and final game in the space quest series. plot the game begins with roger wilco being court martialed for various humorous reasons (all of which roger, being the idiot that he is, cannot defend properly). he is demoted back to his position as second class janitor aboard the scs deepship 86 (a parody of deep space 9). among the reasons for roger being simply demoted and not expelled from starcon is the \"safe return of the scs eureka\". this is a continuity error in that the eureka was in fact destroyed in space quest v, and it was the scs goliath that was safely returned. later, on the deepship, commander kielbasa (named after the kielbasa sausage and a parody of the kilrathi from the wing commander series of video games) announces that, as reward for their excellence in \"a glitch in time saves gamma nine\" (a parody of \"a stitch in time saves nine\"), they are to be given shore leave on the planet polysorbate lx (\"lx\" pronounced \"sixty\", after the preservative). meanwhile, an extremely old and wrinkled woman named sharpei (after the dog breed of the same name, also noted for its wrinkles, and voiced by lucille bliss) is revealed to be plotting roger\\'s demise. it is later revealed that she is the subject of \"project immortality\", which was supposed to prolong life indefinitely. roger\\'s adventures throughout the game have him dealing with a t-1000 like \"endodroid\" (a reference mostly to the replicants from blade runner, including an \"endodroid runner\" giving roger the assignment and speaking with a new york accent), entering cyberspace (mostly a desert canyon like area, an \"office\" resembling windows 3.1, and a seemingly endless room of file cabinets known as the \"file manager\"), and venturing into stellar santiago\\'s digestive system (for which humor is added through gary owens\\' narrations providing scientific detail of everything within each area, as if from a textbook). roger and stellar develop a relationship that almost attracts roger to the point of enamoration for her. this was designed as a way to potentially create another love interest for roger. a running gag in the game is the inclusion of a rotting fish in roger\\'s inventory which he cannot seem to get rid of. it is revealed in an anticlimactic end that the fish is the only way to destroy sharpei, who by the end of the game has become a virus infecting stellar santiago. the game ends on a cliffhanger, with stellar saying that roger \"is going to like his next mission\". despite this, space quest 7 never came to fruition, and the cliffhanger was never resolved. development and release space quest 6: roger wilco in the spinal frontier ran on the later sci32 engine rev 2.100.002. this allowed it to use super vga graphics with 256 colors at 640×480 resolution. unlike other sci games, it did not have the interface in a pull down bar at the top of the screen, but instead used a \"verb bar\" window along the bottom of the screen, similar to lucasarts\\' scumm engine. the graphics style was also more cartoonish than in previous games, as well as incorporating an ample amount of 3-d rendered images. gary owens served as narrator once again. this game was the last to be released in the space quest series. having defeated the diabolical pukoid mutants in space quest v, captain roger wilco triumphantly returns to starcon headquarters - only to be court-martialed due to breaking starcon regulations while saving the galaxy. the game\\'s subtitle comes from the final portion, in which roger has to undergo miniaturization and enter the body of a shipmate and romantic interest, a spoof of the 1987 movie innerspace. (this segment also provided the game\\'s original subtitle, where in corpsman santiago is roger wilco?, which was not used due to legal threats from the makers of the carmen sandiego products.) the romantic interest provides a dilemma for roger (unprecedented in the series) since she is a friend and someone other than the woman who bore roger a son, according to the narrative in space quest iv. josh mandel designed the majority of space quest 6 (with scott murphy on board in a \"creative consultant\" capacity) but had to leave the project shortly before completion due to internal strife with sierra. sierra asked scott murphy to complete the game, and then (reportedly against murphy\\'s wishes) promoted sq6 as if the former \"guy from andromeda\" was solely responsible for it. as an additional result of this change in designers, some puzzles—primarily in the later stages of the game—were poorly implemented due to lack of communication. in a 2006 interview, mandel spoke candidly about his disappointment with the uneven puzzle design and implementation in the game, \"one of the inventory items cut was a comic book cd in nigel\\'s room that was fully readable and had all the hints to the datacorder puzzle. from a writing and design standpoint, it was fully finished, and i know that barry smith had started the artwork. i don\\'t understand why it was cut. but the comic book content was something i\\'d worked on for months, and it was something that i was uncharacteristically proud of ... i think it would\\'ve been one of the greatest parody sequences in the sq series. so not only was i very upset not to see it in the game, but the fact that they had to put the datacorder hints in the manual, leading player to think it was meant to be copy protection, disturbed me greatly.\" sierra on-line created a special cd-rom version of space quest 6s demonstration game, which was distributed with sierra\\'s interaction magazine, pc gamer disc 9 included with volume 2, issue 8 from august 1995, early pressings of phantasmagoria, and possibly other media. this self-contained demonstration featured an alternate story not related to the main game and is fully voiced by the space quest 6 voice actors (early versions of the demo did not have full speech). the demo begins with roger wilco floating in space outside the bridge, washing the viewscreen while everyone else on the bridge is relaxing. suddenly, out of nowhere, an escher cube-shaped ship approaches the deepship 86 and beams aboard two toaster-headed mechanoids - the bjorn (a parody of the borg, with their cube being a parody of the borg cube, and named after tennis champion björn borg). they turn all of the crew into scoops of lemon sorbet (except roger, who quickly ducked behind the viewscreen). now it is up to roger to find a way to restore his crewmates and drive off the bjorn invaders. reception according to sierra on-line, combined sales of the space quest series surpassed 1.2 million units by the end of march 1996. a critic for next generation dismissed space quest 6 as being essentially identical to the previous five installments of the series aside from the specific puzzles. he gave the game three out of five stars, concluding, \"if you liked the first five, you\\'ll want this. if not, you probably aren\\'t even reading this review.\" pc gamer uss gary meredith wrote that it is \"not the best of the space quest series\", as it takes \"a couple of steps backwards as far as the graphics and voice-overs are concerned\". he criticized the game\\'s narration, noting that he had disliked it in space quest iv as well. however, meredith believed that space quest 6 would appeal to fans of the series. space quest 6 tied for third place in computer game reviews 1995 \"adventure game of the year\" award category. the editors noted its \"good voice work\" and \"very nice animation\", and praised its humor. references external links 1995 video games adventure games point-and-click adventure games dos games classic mac os games parody video games scummvm-supported games sierra entertainment games single-player video games space quest windows games games commercially released with dosbox video games developed in the united states',\n",

and the tournament hosts, brazil. argentina won the match 1-0 to clinch their fifteenth copa américa title and first since 1993, giving captain lionel messi his first senior international trophy sixteen years into his career and ending a 28-year trophy drought. argentina also equalled uruguay\\'s record of copa américa titles. argentina would go on to win the conmebol-uefa cup of champions against italy, as well as the 2022 fifa world cup. background argentina and brazil are long-time rivals, having played 107 prior matches in international competition. the two teams are among the most successful in south american football and had met in three prior copa américa finals in 1937, 2004, and 2007. in bangladesh, where the two teams have large fanbases, police banned outdoor gatherings in certain rural districts after clashes erupted between rival fans. in the brahmanbaria district, a clash between fans resulted in serious injuries to four people. venue the 2021 copa américa was originally planned to be hosted by argentina and colombia, with the final scheduled for 12 july 2020 at the estadio metropolitano roberto meléndez in barranquilla, colombia. on 17 march 2020, conmebol announced that the tournament would be postponed by a year due to the covid-19 pandemic, alongside the 2020 european championships. weeks before the tournament, colombia was removed as host amid the ongoing protests in the country, while argentina announced that they would be unable to host due to the worsening covid-19 case rate and were replaced with brazil despite their high death rate. for the second consecutive time, the final was held at rio de janeiro\\'s maracanã stadium, the largest stadium in brazil. it was opened at 10 percent capacity, or 6,500 spectators, for the match due to covid-19 restrictions. the stadium was excluded from hosting matches in earlier rounds of the competition due to its damaged pitch and was replaced with estádio olímpico nilton santos, where players criticised the playing surface. the pitch at the maracanã was re-laid by conmebol a few days before the final. officials the referee in charge of the match was esteban ostojich from uruguay. ostojich,

behind uruguay\\'s all-time total of 15 titles, but had not won since 1993. the team was seeded into group a one of the tournament\\'s original co-hosts and was joined by bolivia, uruguay, chile, paraguay, and invitees australia until their withdrawal. argentina had been transitioning away from its 2010s \"golden generation\" in favor of a younger core, which was reflected in manager lionel scaloni\\'s call-ups for la albiceleste. the team remained led by captain lionel messi, along with veterans ángel di maría and sergio agüero, as the last three remaining members of the 2014 world cup team that finished as runners-up to germany. la albiceleste opened the group stage against chile, earning a 1-1 draw. lionel messi scored a free kick to give argentina the lead in the first half, but eduardo vargas equalised in the second half by finishing a rebound shot after a penalty taken by arturo vidal was saved. argentina moved to the top of group a by defeating uruguay 1-0 with a header scored by guido rodríguez off a cross from messi. the team secured a berth in the knockout stage on the third matchday with a 1-0 victory against paraguay; papu gómez scored the lone goal of the match in the 10th minute, receiving a through ball from di maría while unmarked in the penalty area. in the final match of the group stage, against bolivia, argentina won 4-1 to take first place in group a.

own in stoppage time. the semi-final fixture against colombia began with an early goal for martínez in the seventh minute, but finished 1-1 in regulation time after an equaliser from luis díaz in the 61st minute. in the ensuing penalty shoot-out, argentina goalkeeper emiliano martínez saved three shots to give the team a 3-2 win after five rounds. the match featured 10 yellow cards and 47 fouls, both setting records for the copa américa. brazil brazil had the third-most copa américa titles, at nine, and were defending their 2019 title. the team was drawn into group b alongside original co-hosts colombia, venezuela, ecuador, peru, and invitees qatar until their withdrawal. manager tite called up a majority of the players used in 2022 fifa world cup qualifying for much of 2020 and 2021, led by captain thiago silva and star forward neymar. despite a rumoured boycott reported in several newspapers, the brazil squad agreed to play in the tournament but criticised conmebol for its

third match through a 10th-minute bicycle kick scored by luis díaz, but the seleção earned a 2-1 comeback victory through headers from roberto firmino in the 78th minute and casemiro in the tenth minute of stoppage time. firmino\\'s equaliser was the subject of protests from colombia due to the ball hitting the referee earlier in the sequence, but was ruled valid by the video assistant referee. brazil\\'s winning streak was ended at ten matches after a 1-1 draw with ecuador to close out the group stage, finishing atop group b while resting several starting players. a 37th-minute header from éder militão, scoring his first international goal, gave brazil a half-time lead, but substitute ángel mena equalised for ecuador in the 53rd minute with a strike after a corner kick failed to be cleared. brazil were held to a scoreless first half in their quarter-finals fixture against chile, but broke through with a 46th-minute strike from half-time substitute lucas paquetá. two minutes later, the team lost gabriel jesus to a red card after a high kick to the face of eugenio mena, but brazil kept a shutout to win 1-0. the semi-final fixture against peru marked a rematch from the group stage and the 2019 final for the seleção. the match ended in a 1-0 victory for brazil, with the lone goal scored by paquetá in the 35th minute after neymar dribbled past three defenders to provide an assist. match summary the match began after a minute of silence for victims of the covid-19 pandemic, with argentina leading in possession and early chances. brazilian midfielder fred received a yellow card in the third minute for a challenge on gonzalo montiel, beginning a series of fouls from players on both teams. ángel di maría opened the scoring for argentina in the 22nd minute, receiving a long pass from rodrigo de paul and beating defender renan lodi to lob the ball over the advancing goalkeeper ederson. brazil responded with a series of attacks, including one that forced a save out of emiliano martínez, but lost possession to an argentina counter-attack that ended in a missed shot from lionel messi after the half-hour mark. the first half ended with a 1-0 lead for argentina. brazil manager tite replaced fred with attacking midfielder roberto firmino to begin the second half in search of an equaliser. di maría\\'s attempt to extend argentina\\'s lead in the 50th minute was blocked and led to a brazilian counterattack through neymar that was suppressed by a foul by giovani lo celso, who received a yellow card. richarlison appeared to have equalised for brazil with a shot from inside the penalty area in the 52nd minute that was ruled offside; he followed up a minute later with another strike that was saved by martínez. nicolás otamendi was shown a yellow card in the 81st minute for a foul on neymar, which triggered arguments and a shoving match between both sides. after a pair of chances for brazil that were repelled by martínez, argentina sprung on a counterattack in the 88th minute that ended with messi stumbling while trying to dribble around ederson. the match ended in a 1-0 victory for argentina, securing their first copa américa title since 1993. details statistics post-match argentina won their 15th copa américa, tying uruguay for the all-time record in the tournament, after finishing as runners-up in four editions since

       " 'libya allegedly bankrolled the presidential campaign of nicolas sarkozy with up to €50 million in pay-outs. sarkozy has denied wrongdoing and rejected suggestions he was a libyan agent of influence during his tenure as president of france. he has since officially been convicted of corruption in 2021. background 2007 election in may 2007, nicolas sarkozy was elected president of france in a six-point victory over ségolène royal. sarkozy officially spent €21 million on his campaign. the size of the campaign spend, relative to those seen in united states elections, prompted french scholar sophie meunier to later declare that \"french politicians are, therefore, not enslaved to special interests or super-pacs as they are in the u.s.\" during the 2007 french election, candidates were limited to spending no more than €21 million, and no single person could donate in excess of €7500 to a candidate. in addition, the sources of donations had to be publicly declared and contributions from foreign nationals were prohibited. libyan détente and later reversal in december 2007, following sarkozy\\'s inauguration as president of france, libyan leader muammar gaddafi visited the country on sarkozy\\'s invitation, over the objections of both the political opposition and members of sarkozy\\'s government. gaddafi\\'s visit to france was his first in over 35 years; during the trip, france agreed to sell libya 21 airbus aircraft, and the two countries signed a nuclear cooperation agreement. negotiations for the sale of over a dozen french dassault rafale fighter jets, plus military helicopters, were also initiated during gaddafi\\'s visit. in 2011, france, under sarkozy, voted for international military intervention in the libyan civil war against the gaddafi government in united nations security council resolution 1973 and, subsequently, attacked libyan government forces in opération harmattan, in support of the national transitional council. france stated the move was to protect libyan civilians. allegations the same month that french forces were committed to the libyan conflict, saif-al-islam gaddafi, a son of muammar gaddafi, gave an interview to euronews in which he first publicly claimed that the libyan state had donated €50 million to sarkozy\\'s 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for access and favours by sarkozy. he was quoted as saying: \"we funded it and we have all the details and are ready to reveal everything. the first thing we want this clown to do is to give the money back to the libyan people. he was given assistance so that he could help them. but he\\'s disappointed us: give us back our money.\" sarkozy rejected the claim by gaddafi. the following october, the claim that libya had funded sarkozy\\'s 2007 election campaign was repeated by former libyan prime minister baghdadi mahmudi. investigative website mediapart subsequently published several documents appearing to prove payment of €50 million and also published a claim by ziad takieddine that he had personally handed three briefcases full of cash to sarkozy. french magistrates later acquired the diaries of former libyan oil minister shukri ghanem in which payments to sarkozy were mentioned. shortly thereafter, however, ghanem was found dead, floating in the danube in austria and thereby preventing his corroboration of the diaries. in 2014, television station france 3 released an audio recording made by delphine minoui on march 16, 2011, during which minoui interviewed muammar gaddafi. in the recording, gaddafi told minoui that sarkozy had approached him seeking funds for his presidential election campaign while still serving as french interior minister. in february 2018, the asharq al-awsat newspaper quoted a source alleging that sarkozy had promised libyan representatives improved relations between france and libya should he be elected president and that he would wrap up the matter of the bombing of uta flight 772. as recently as 2018, saif al-islam reiterated his 2011 claim, and since also added that a former officer of the libyan intelligence service was at that time in possession of a recording of a meeting between muammar gaddafi and sarkozy that occurred in tripoli in 2007, during which payments were discussed. investigation in 2013 the central directorate of the judicial police (dcpj) officially opened an investigation into the allegations of libyan funding of sarkozy\\'s 2007 election campaign. in march 2018, sarkozy-era interior minister brice hortefeux voluntarily appeared before french police for questioning. several arrests have been made in relation to the inquiry. arrests and charges reaction sarkozy\\'s political party, the republicans, issued a statement following his arrest in which it said the former president had the party\\'s full support. spokesman christian jacob later suggested that the accusations against sarkozy were politically motivated. following sarkozy\\'s arrest, eric ciotti expressed confidence the former president would be exonerated. on 1 march 2021, sarkozy was convicted of different corruption charges, after investigators looking into the libyan finance allegations wiretapped conversations between sarkozy and his lawyer, thierry herzog. on 17 may 2023 this conviction was confirmed by the paris court of appeals as was the sentence

       " \"mirror dance is a hugo- and locus-award-winning science fiction novel by lois mcmaster bujold. part of the vorkosigan saga, it was first published by baen books in march 1994, and is included in the 2002 omnibus miles errant. plot summary mark, miles vorkosigan's clone, masquerades as him and dupes his mercenary force, the dendarii, into undertaking a mission to free about 50 clones on jackson's whole, an anything-goes freebooters' planet where mark was created and raised. these teenage clones are scheduled to have their brains replaced by those of their wealthy, aged progenitors. when miles finds out, he attempts to rescue his troops and his brother from the mess mark has made, but is killed by a needle grenade. he is frozen in a cryonic chamber on the spot, but the medic in charge becomes separated from the rest of the men while retreating under fire. the medic uses an automated shipping system to send the chamber to safety, but is killed before he can tell anyone what he did and where he sent it. the dendarii flee the debacle and take mark to miles' parents on barrayar. cordelia accepts him as another son and has him acknowledged legally as a member of the family. after a while, mark becomes frustrated by barrayaran imperial security's lack of progress; he is convinced that miles is still on jackson's whole, and decides to go there himself. cordelia helps by buying him a starship. he invites some of the dendarii along, including captain quinn, miles' second-in-command and lover. meanwhile, miles has been secretly received and resuscitated by the duronas, a research group cloned from a medical genius and employed by jackson's whole magnate baron fell. they hope they have miles (rather than mark) under their care, but he is suffering from normal, hopefully temporary, post-revival amnesia, so they are unsure. the duronas wish to hire the dendarii, who are known for pulling off difficult extractions, to help them escape from jackson's whole. miles' memory takes some time to return. mark finds miles, but is captured by miles' old nemesis, baron ryoval, and tortured for five days. his personality fragments into four sub-personalities: gorge the glutton, grunt the sex pervert, howl the masochist, and killer the assassin. together, the first three protect mark's fragile persona, while killer bides his time. when ryoval's assistant informs him that mark seems to have adjusted remarkably quickly and is actually enjoying the torture, a frustrated ryoval decides to study his victim alone. killer takes the opportunity to kill ryoval, enabling mark to escape. mark sells ryoval's security access codes to baron fell for a large sum of money and the durona group's freedom. miles' short death and revivification have serious repercussions for his health. mark has his own problems, thanks to his strange upbringing, complicated by the torture. when he asks his mother for help, she sends him to beta colony for psychiatric treatment and therapy. by necessity, this novel is told from the viewpoints of miles and mark. this was the first novel in the vorkosigan series to be written this way, though not the first time bujold has employed this style; the first occasion was in falling free. awards mirror dance won both the hugo award for best novel and the locus award for best science fiction novel in 1995. references 1994 american novels 1994 science fiction novels american science fiction novels hugo award for best novel-winning works novels by lois mcmaster bujold vorkosigan saga fiction about suspended animation\",\n",

       " 'vivian stanshall (born victor anthony stanshall; 21 march 1943 - 5 march 1995) was an english singer-songwriter, musician, author, poet and wit, best known for his work with the bonzo dog doo-dah band, for his exploration of the british upper classes in sir henry at rawlinson end (as a radio series for john peel, as an audio recording, as a book and as a film), and for acting as master of ceremonies on mike oldfield\\'s album tubular bells. early life and education stanshall was born on 21 march 1943 at the radcliffe maternity home shillingford, oxfordshire, son of victor george stanshall (1909-1990; born vivian), at the time of his son\\'s birth an raf corporal, later a company secretary, then company director (fcis), and eileen monica prudence (née wadeson). he was christened victor anthony. he lived with his mother while his father served in the raf during the second world war. stanshall described this early period as the happiest time of his childhood. when the war ended his father returned, but the young victor found him difficult and comparatively stern after having been alone with his mother. his father made him speak with a \"plummy\" accent for which he later became known. the family moved to the father\\'s hometown of walthamstow, essex, where stanshall\\'s younger brother mark was born in 1949. with six years between them, the brothers were never close. stanshall studied at walthamstow college of art, where he met fellow students ian dury and peter greenaway. when he was 10, the stanshall family moved to the essex coastal town of leigh-on-sea. he attended southend high school for boys until 1959. as a young man, stanshall (known as vic) earned money doing various odd jobs at the kursaal fun fair in nearby southend-on-sea. these included working as a bingo caller and spending the winter painting the fairground attractions. to set aside enough money to get through art school (his father having refused to fund this), stanshall spent a year in the merchant navy. he said he was a very bad waiter, but became a great teller of tall tales. stanshall enrolled at the central school of art and design in london. he joined fellow students in forming a band (including rodney slater, roger ruskin spear and neil innes, who was studying art at goldsmiths college). innes said of their first meeting: \"we first met in a big irish pub in south london, the new cross arms ... he was quite plump in those days, and he was wearing billy bunter check trousers, a victorian frock coat, black coat tails, horrible little oval, violet-tinted pince-nez glasses, he had a euphonium under his arm, and large rubber false ears. and i thought, well, this is an interesting character.\" at about this time, stanshall changed his first name to \\'vivian\\', the name his father had abandoned. this was not made his legal name until 1977. those who knew him from his student days continued to call him \\'vic\\'. later friends and collaborators knew him as \\'viv\\'. bonzo years the bonzo dog doo-dah band were named after a word game that stanshall played with co-founder slater, in which they cut up sentences and juxtaposed fragments to form new ones. \\'bonzo dog/dada\\' was one result which they liked. the band initially performed under this name, but grew tired of explaining what dada meant; hence they changed it to the bonzo dog doo-dah band, \\'doo-dah\\' being a quaint expression that both slater\\'s mother and stanshall himself used to describe everyday objects. later this name was shortened to the bonzo dog band, or just the bonzos. much of the band\\'s original repertoire was based on comedic re-workings of songs from the 1920s and 1930s, found on 78 records, bought for pennies from local flea markets. for a while the band operated semi-professionally, playing local pubs and the college circuit. after acquiring a manager, they went full-time and were booked on the working men\\'s club circuit, mainly in the north of england. the band dominated their lives, as they frequently travelled to low-paying gigs in an old van crammed with any number of musical instruments, an assortment of props, and prop robots. in 1967, they appeared in the beatles\\' television film magical mystery tour, in which they played stanshall\\'s \"death cab for cutie\" during the strip club scene. the appearance led to a spot as the house band on do not adjust your set, a weekly children\\'s television revue series that was also notable for early appearances by half of what became the monty python team. according to their manager/agent gerry bron, after a perhaps ill-advised agreement that the band should be left to their own artistic devices, stanshall was allowed several weeks in a hired rehearsal space to write songs for the new bonzo dog band album. when bron arrived at the location to check the progress of these endeavours, he found that stanshall had not written anything at all and had instead built a variety of hutches for his pet rabbits. bron mentioned in a television documentary that this occurred in may 1968 in a hall in acton, west london; the actual location is askew road church hall, at the start of bassein park road in shepherd\\'s bush. the date would suggest that these were rehearsals for the album the doughnut in granny\\'s greenhouse. during recordings for the album proper at morgan studios, stanshall, wearing just a rabbit\\'s head and underpants, interviewed members of the public in willesden high road. on the album track \"we are normal\", one interviewee can be heard to remark, \\'he\\'s got a head on him like a rabbit.\\' later in 1968, the bonzos scored a surprise top-ten hit with \"i\\'m the urban spaceman\" co-produced by paul mccartney and gus dudgeon under the alias \\'apollo c. vermouth\\'. meanwhile the band toured incessantly and recorded a multitude of radio sessions for the bbc, alongside several albums. they also embarked upon two poorly organised but well-received tours of the united states. (neil innes remembers that the band were stopped by a local sheriff and asked if they were carrying any firearms or drugs. when they denied both, the officer asked how they were going to defend themselves. stanshall piped up from the back of the minibus, \"with good manners!\") it was during the particularly disastrously organised second tour that the bonzos decided to break up, partly because of stanshall\\'s growing stage fright - combined with his increasing use of valium to help combat this - but also because of anger with their management, after spear\\'s wife suffered a miscarriage while he was away, and no-one informed him. the band subsequently decided to split whilst they were still friends. they played their last show in march 1970, at loughborough university. after the bonzos stanshall formed a number of short-lived groups during 1970 alone, including big grunt (formed while the bonzos were still on their farewell tour, and including fellow bonzos roger ruskin spear and dennis cowan, and with anthony \\'bubs\\' white on guitar), the sean head showband (again featuring cowan and white), gargantuan chums, and the slightly longer-lived bonzo dog freaks, with innes and the ever-faithful cowan and white (this conglomerate was also known simply as \\'freaks\\'). early that year, big grunt recorded a well-received session for bbc radio 1 disc jockey john peel, and shortly afterwards made a memorable appearance on bbc television. despite this promising start, big grunt dissolved during their first uk tour when stanshall became incapacitated by the onset of an anxiety disorder that caused a nervous breakdown and would continue to plague him for the rest of his life. however, he soon recovered sufficiently to record and release, on the liberty label, his first solo single \"labio-dental fricative/paper round\", credited to vivian stanshall and the sean head showband (an oblique reference to stanshall having shaved off all of his hair during his breakdown), and featuring eric clapton on guitar. later in the year, his single version of terry stafford\\'s song \"suspicion\", credited to vivian stanshall and gargantuan chums and featuring keith moon and john entwistle of the who, was released. featured on the b-side was \"blind date\", the only officially released track by big grunt. (however, all of stanshall\\'s backing bands of 1970 featured the same core personnel, so it could be argued that they were essentially the same band, masquerading under a variety of names.) in early 1971, stanshall reunited again with innes, cowan and white as \\'freaks\\' to tour new material. in order to promote ticket sales, they were more often than not billed as \\'bonzo dog freaks\\'. with keith moon guesting on drums, freaks quickly recorded a bbc radio session for john peel that featured solo numbers by stanshall and innes alongside tracks from let\\'s make up and be friendly, the bonzos\\' yet-to-be recorded contractual obligation/reunion album of 1972. the session is also notable for marking the first appearance in any medium of an episode of stanshall\\'s magnum opus, rawlinson end. stanshall also found time during this period to be a founder member of the performance/poetry/music group grimms, alongside innes, the scaffold and associated poets and musicians. although stanshall left grimms before they made any recordings, he did continue to perform live with them on occasion. throughout this period, still suffering badly with anxiety and now drinking heavily to self-medicate, stanshall nonetheless continued to write, record and tour with freaks and grimms (and briefly as guest touring frontman for the temperance seven in 1972). he was also a regular guest, broadcaster and presenter on numerous series on bbc radio. despite his ongoing personal difficulties, stanshall\\'s humorous exploits continued unabated. his adventures with long-time drinking buddy keith moon (who would become stanshall\\'s regular partner in crime for much of the 1970s after producing and appearing on stanshall\\'s single \"suspicion\") were legendary. in one quite possibly apocryphal example, stanshall visited a tailor\\'s shop where he admired a pair of trousers on display. moon then arrived, posing as another customer, and admired the same trousers, demanding to buy them. when stanshall protested, the two men fought and split the trousers in two, so that they ended up with one leg each; the tailor, understandably, became furious. then, a one-legged actor - hired by stanshall and moon - arrived, saw the split trousers, and proclaimed: \"ah! just what i was looking for! i\\'ll buy them!\" thanks to his association with john peel, in 1971 stanshall was asked to fill in for the disc jockey while he was on a month\\'s holiday. the resulting short series, titled vivian stanshall\\'s radio flashes, was recorded under the supervision of peel\\'s regular producer john walters and broadcast on bbc radio one on saturday afternoons during august 1971. the series of four two-hour programmes were a mix of music and specially written and recorded comedic sketches. of the original four episodes, only episodes 2, 3 and 4 remain in the bbc archives; these were re-broadcast on bbc radio 4 extra in 2014 and again in 2016. all four episodes and a christmas 1971 compilation special have also circulated among collectors as low-quality, edited off-air recordings since the 1970s. contributors to the sketches in radio flashes included moon, traffic\\'s jim capaldi and actress chris bowler. the sketches included a four-part serial adventure titled \"breath from the pit\", featuring the surreal exploits of a dick barton or bulldog drummond-style gentleman adventurer, colonel knutt (played by stanshall) and his working-class sidekick, the \\'likeable cheeky cockney, lemmy\\'. this character was a thinly-veiled parody of the character of the same name from charles chilton\\'s journey into space, with moon playing the role of lemmy. rawlinson end stanshall had developed what many consider to be his seminal work, rawlinson end, as a spoken word performance piece during the first few years of the 1970s, recording an early version as part of the bonzo dog band\\'s reunion project let\\'s make up and be friendly. beginning in 1975, he expanded upon the concept as an episodic surrealist radio serial for bbc radio 1\\'s john peel slot, elaborating further upon the weird and wonderful adventures of the inebriated and blimpish sir henry rawlinson, his wife, the distanced and ethereal florrie, his \"unusual\" brother hubert, loyal manservant old scrotum \\'the wrinkled retainer\\', the rambling and unhygienic cook mrs e.; and many other inhabitants of the crumbling rawlinson end and its environs. stanshall had been playing around with the rawlinson characters for some time, and they were first referred to on the bonzos\\' 1967 number, \"the intro and the outro\": \\'great to hear the rawlinsons on trombone.\\' in 1978, stanshall released an album, sir henry at rawlinson end, that reworked some material from the peel sessions. this in turn was adapted into a film version in 1980, which was produced in a sepia-tinted black-and-white. it starred trevor howard as sir henry, and stanshall as hubert. some of the film\\'s music was provided in collaboration with stanshall\\'s friend steve winwood. a book of the same title - by stanshall, illustrated with stills from the film - was published by eel pie publishing in 1980. nominally a film novelisation, it was distilled from the various versions and included considerable material that did not make it to the film. a projected second book, the eating at rawlinson end, was never completed. a second rawlinson album, sir henry at n\\'didi\\'s kraal (1984), recounts sir henry\\'s disastrous african expedition, omitting the rest of the rawlinson clan. at the time, stanshall was living on the searchlight, a houseboat that he had bought from denny laine and kept moored near shepperton on the river thames. he lived on the searchlight from 1977 to 1983, and recorded and produced the second \\'sir henry\\' album on it during a period of debilitating physical illness. the album was disowned by stanshall after its release, as he said it was both unfinished and unsatisfactory, and that the record label had rush-released it without his permission in an attempt to profit from his potentially imminent demise. however, the noticeably superior bbc radio broadcasts continued sporadically until late 1991. in the same year, a temporarily rejuvenated stanshall embarked upon a nationwide concert tour, titled \\'rawlinson dog ends\\', with support from former bonzos and centred around a performance of new rawlinson end material. \\'sir henry\\' was last seen in a television commercial for ruddles real ale (c. 1994), where he was portrayed by a cross-dressing dawn french, presiding over a family banquet at a long table; shortly afterwards, stanshall himself reprised the role of hubert, reciting a poem loosely based on edward lear\\'s \"the owl and the pussycat\". during this same period, stanshall embarked upon the recording of a proposed new rawlinson end album, but this activity was curtailed in its early stages by its creator\\'s untimely death in march 1995. after this, bbc radio 4 retrieved some of the original peel show recordings from the vaults for late-night repeat during christmas 1996. 1970s stanshall regularly performed live with grimms, as well as occasionally working with the alberts and the temperance seven during the first few years of the decade. he was also a frequent contributor to bbc radio at this time, appearing weekly on start the week and jack de manio precisely, and also on the bbc television satire series up sunday. in 1973, stanshall recorded tracks for the soundtrack album of the movie that\\'ll be the day backed by moon, ronnie wood, graham bond and jack bruce, and collaborated on numerous musical projects, making a memorable appearance as the master of ceremonies on mike oldfield\\'s 1973 album tubular bells. (he reprised the role for tubular bells ii in 1992, but the final release featured alan rickman instead.) stanshall made guest appearances on a number of other artists\\' recordings including john entwistle\\'s smash your head against the wall in 1971, mike hart\\'s basher, chalky, pongo and me in 1972, pete brown\\'s the not forgotten association in 1973, and robert calvert\\'s 1974 concept album captain lockheed and the starfighters. in early 1974, stanshall wrote, arranged, and quickly recorded his first solo album, men opening umbrellas ahead. a rather more serious work than many would have expected, its darkly comic lyrics detailed stanshall\\'s alcoholism and troubled emotional state, laced with surreal poetic imagery and literary reference. other lyrics included implicit references to other musicians and the music business, and a rather more explicit satire of the author\\'s relationship with his own penis. musically, while certain tracks display stanshall\\'s usual keen sense of rock and roll parody, most of the album has a \\'tribal\\' or \\'fusion\\' flavour. prominently featuring the nigerian musician gasper lawal and with many tracks infused with richly textured african percussion and chorus vocal stylings, the album (and its contemporary single \"lakonga\") can justifiably lay claim to being an early, unheralded example of a crossover between world music and rock music. stanshall\\'s long-standing friends and colleagues innes, white, traffic\\'s steve winwood, jim capaldi, ric grech and rebop kwaku baah, doris troy and madeline bell also made notable guest appearances. deleted after its first pressing and out of print for many years, the album was finally re-released on cd in 2012. the bbc documentary one man\\'s week, broadcast on 9 april 1975, documented a week in stanshall\\'s life and included footage of him at the manor recording studio during the sessions for men opening umbrellas ahead, where he played with white, lawal, mongezi feza, and derek (or deryk) quinn. in 1975, stanshall provided the narration for peter and the wolf, produced by robin lumley and jack lancaster and featuring, among others, gary moore, manfred mann, phil collins, bill bruford, stéphane grappelli, alvin lee, cozy powell, brian eno and jon hiseman. 1976 saw the release of his single \"the young ones\", where the old cliff richard standard was delivered in the style of boris karloff. in 1977, stanshall and his companion, pamela \\'ki\\' longfellow, moved into a houseboat, the searchlight, moored on the thames between chertsey and shepperton. during this period, stanshall compiled and re-recorded material from his popular bbc radio 1 broadcasts for peel, which was released as sir henry at rawlinson end in 1978. he also wrote the script for the film adaptation of the same name, later produced for tony stratton smith\\'s charisma records company in 1980. 1980s following \\'sir henry\\', stanshall wrote the songs for his third album teddy boys don\\'t knit (1981), which included three songs about his family, and contributed a lyric to winwood\\'s arc of a diver. he and longfellow married in 1980, and together they wrote some of the songs they later used for a musical comedy, stinkfoot, a comic opera. in 1982, stanshall provided a spoken word segment on \"lovely money\", a single by the damned. after the searchlight eventually sank, the stanshalls lived and worked on the thekla, a baltic trader, which ki sailed 732 nautical miles (1,356 km) from sunderland to be moored in the bristol docks. ki had bought the vessel and converted her into a floating theatre called \\'the old profanity showboat\\'. stanshall joined her on it in 1983, when they opened the doors of the theatre. by this time, he was already suffering from alcohol and drug abuse, having become addicted to valium while trying to control his anxiety. in december 1985, the old profanity showboat produced the debut of their work stinkfoot, a comic opera. stanshall wrote 27 original songs for the opera, sharing book and lyric writing with his wife. it has proved popular over the years, and was revived in london some years later, with peter moss as musical director. it was also produced in concert form in bristol, in july 2010. having returned to london alone in 1986 while his wife recovered from an illness, stanshall saw stinkfoot briefly, but unsuccessfully, revived at the bloomsbury theatre. after this, he returned to the stage again, touring in a solo show, \\'rawlinson dog-ends\\', initially with support from musicians including jack bruce. when bruce quit, over a lack of adequate rehearsals, moss stepped in to provide bass. marriage and family in 1968, stanshall married fellow art student monica peiser, and their son rupert was born that year. they divorced in 1975. on 9 september 1980, stanshall married pamela \\'ki\\' longfellow, an american writer who had a daughter from an earlier relationship. the stanshalls had a daughter, silky, born on 16 august 1979, before they married; she was named after silky sullivan, a racehorse that was a childhood favourite of her mother. stanshall celebrated silky\\'s birth in \"the tube\", and his marriage to ki in \"bewilderbeeste\", both songs being included on his album teddy boys don\\'t knit. he later gave his wife the name of \\'ki\\' from a dream. even though their comic opera stinkfoot was a success in late 1985, stanshall returned alone to london after the turn of the year, while longfellow recuperated from an illness brought on by overwork and stress. the stanshalls lived apart until his sudden death in march 1995. years later, longfellow wrote the illustrated vivian stanshall: a fairytale of grimm art, detailing stanshall\\'s life and work from 1977 to 1995. memoirs in 1991, stanshall made a 15-minute autobiographical piece called vivian stanshall: the early years, a.k.a. crank, for bbc2\\'s the late show. he confessed to having been terrified of his father, who he said had always disapproved of him. his last television appearance, on the late show, was broadcast on 27 november that year. a programme for bbc radio 4, vivian stanshall: essex teenager to renaissance man (1994) included an interview with his mother. she insisted his father had loved him. stanshall said on the same programme that his father had never shown it, not even on his deathbed. death stanshall was found dead on the morning of 6 march 1995, after an electrical fire had broken out as he slept in his top-floor flat in muswell hill, north london. his private funeral service was held at the golders green crematorium, north london. a few days later his memorial service was held at st patrick\\'s church, soho square. a memorial plaque was unveiled in the poets\\' corner at golders green crematorium on 13 december 2015, opposite that of his friend keith moon, by his widow ki and his daughter silky. others attending included actor tony slattery, singer linda thompson and actress cherri gilham. the cost of the plaque was met by many of his fans and friends via online crowdfunding. legacy and honours writing in the independent after stanshall\\'s death, chris welch wrote: \"seen by some as a wild eccentric, and a powerful personality who could be both charming and intimidating, stanshall was perhaps too large a figure even for the music business to handle. ... he needed a producer to channel his energies, but always wanted to remain his own boss, having suffered too many perceived indignities in his early experience of the music business.\" he was described by neil innes as \"a national treasure\". in 2001, welch and lucian randall wrote a biography titled ginger geezer: the life of vivian stanshall. in the same year, jeremy pascall and stephen fry produced a documentary about stanshall for bbc radio 4. fry knew stanshall quite well and, along with his personal thoughts, introduced a series of reminiscences. the show featured many clips from stanshall\\'s work. the recording includes one of stanshall\\'s last poems, titled \"with my mouth turned down for the night\". in 2003, sea urchin editions published the script of the stanshalls\\' stinkfoot: an english comic opera, with an introduction by his widow, ki. on 22 december 2009, bbc radio 4\\'s series great lives featured a programme on stanshall, who had been nominated by neil innes, with ki longfellow as expert witness, hosted by matthew parris. in june 2010, the 1978 album sir henry at rawlinson end was re-imagined by michael livesley as a one-man show, in which he starred as the narrator and all the characters, backed by a six-piece band replicating the instrumentation of the original. the production won rave reviews, then premiered in london on 14 october 2011. it also drew praise from innes and adrian edmondson, who were in the audience. on 25 march 2013, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of stanshall\\'s birth, livesley was joined by innes, rick wakeman, danny thompson, rodney slater, sam spoons, vernon dudley bowhay-nowell, \\'legs\\' larry smith and john otway, to perform sir henry at rawlinson end at the bloomsbury theatre. the event was organised by livesley and stanshall\\'s son rupert. on 11 october 2011, the blackpool comedy carpet, a large public artwork by gordon young, was unveiled in blackpool on the town\\'s seaside promenade. it is made of 300 slabs of granite that cover about 2200 square meters. featuring catchphrases, jokes and names, it commemorates more than 1000 selected \"influential\" comics, most of whom have played blackpool in the last hundred years. the project was commissioned by the blackpool council as part of its redevelopment plan, and it is one of the largest pieces of public art in the united kingdom. stanshall is represented in the work by two quotes and his name. in 2012, poppydisc records reissued both a vinyl and cd version of stanshall\\'s men opening umbrellas ahead, remastered with new liner notes from his widow and daughter. on 26 january 2018, longfellow\\'s biography/memoir/free-form art book detailing stanshall\\'s life was published. filled with stanshall\\'s paintings, sketches, notes, letters, and private photographs, the illustrated vivian stanshall, a fairytale of grimm art (illustrated by the young illustrator and animator ben wickey) contains not only longfellow\\'s impressions of the life and work of her husband of 18 years, but also the remembrances of many of his closest friends, as well as vivian\\'s private journals. in july 2023 madfish music released two posthumously completed albums by stanshall: dog howl in tune, a rock album originally intended as a follow-up to teddy boys don\\'t knit; and rawlinson\\'s end, using the remaining tapes from vivian\\'s archive. in the case of rawlinson\\'s end, some of the narration and music was recorded by stanshall, while the rest incorporates material from the existing bbc

       " 'the federated indians of graton rancheria, formerly known as the federated coast miwok, is a federally recognized american indian tribe of coast miwok and southern pomo indians. the tribe was officially restored to federal recognition in 2000 by the u.s. government pursuant to the graton rancheria restoration act. early history prior to european contact, the residents of marin and sonoma counties were bands of native californians belonging to two linguistic and cultural groups: the coast miwok and southern pomo, living in close proximity to each other and indigenous to marin and southern sonoma counties in northern california. occupied at various times during more than thirty centuries, over 600 village sites have been identified in the coast miwok territory, stretching from bodega bay to the north, eastward beyond the towns of cotati and sonoma, and along the point reyes national seashore and the shores of tomales bay. the year 1579 was the earliest recorded account made by the europeans of the coast miwok people on the coast of marin in the point reyes area, as documented in a diary by chaplain fletcher who was aboard sir francis drake\\'s ship. in 1595, the coast miwok came into contact with the crew of the san agustin, a manila galleon, captained by sebastião rodrigues soromenho and crewed by filipino mariners. during the mission period of 1779-1823, mission san francisco de asís (also called \"mission dolores\"), mission san rafael arcángel and mission san francisco solano used indians, including the coast miwok and southern pomo people, as a key source of labor. as early as 1830, a filipino named domingo felix married a coast miwok woman named euphrasia valencia, and they started a family who later settled in lairds landing in 1861. the family who descended from this multiracial couple remained there until 1955. some of the coast miwok trace their lineage to this couple. the territorial lands of the southern pomo are in sonoma county, south of the russian river to the southern santa rosa area. the southern pomo were the first inhabitants of what is now the town of sebastopol, with several smaller traditional southern pomo villages located southeast of sebastopol along the laguna de santa rosa. california anthropologist alfred l. kroeber stated: batiklechawi, at sebastapol at the head of the slough known as laguna de santa rosa, was an important town, and therefore presumably the headquarters of a division [of the southern pomo]. another group tentatively may be inferred as having occupied the bulk of the shores of the laguna. recent history most of the coast miwok continued to live in their traditional lands through the 20th century. they worked in sawmills, as agricultural laborers, and fished to supplement their incomes. the graton rancheria was a indian rancheria near sebastopol in sonoma county. the rancheria was established for coast miwok, southern pomo, and other indians living in the region. in 1920, when indians began to settle the land, they discovered that all but were inhospitable. the us government terminated the trust agreement (federal recognition) of the graton rancheria in 1958. gloria armstrong (miwok) privately owned a lot of the previous rancheria. in 1992, the tribe initiated the procedure to regain federal recognition. recognition was achieved on december 27, 2000 through the graton rancheria restoration act passed by the u.s. congress. on april 18, 2008, the tribe acquired of land. since 2007, the federated indians of graton rancheria has collaborated with occidental arts and ecology in occidental, california to create workshops called tradition environmental knowledge on organic farming, herbology, native plant restoration, and ethnobotany. government the tribe has approximately 1,438 members (1,438 as of october 1, 2019). the tribe\\'s government offices are located in rohnert park, california. tribal governmental programs and services include sacred sites preservation and protection, indian housing, indian education, membership, cultural arts, social services, and tribal health. the federated indians of graton rancheria are governed by a seven-member tribal council who are elected to two-year terms by the adult tribal membership. the current administration includes: tribal chairman: greg sarris vice-chair: lorelle w. b. ross

       " 'audley dean nicols (22 september 1875-13 november 1941) was an american artist, illustrator and muralist. born and raised in sewickley, pennsylvania; he studied in new york and europe, and worked as an illustrator for various national magazines in the united states. he moved to el paso, texas in the early 1920s, where he painted desert landscapes of the american southwest. nicols achieved national recognition during his lifetime; his style and choice of subjects gathering followers who became known as the \"purple mountain painters\". life and career born in 1875 in sewickley from pittsburgh along the ohio river, audley dean nicols was the son of parshall d. nicols, an iron broker, and elizabeth \"lizzie\" agnes mclaughlin, an art teacher. he had a sister, alice clyde nicols, and two brothers, verner, who died of the spanish flu, and lowell, who was an art critic and an optical glass research chemist. his mother lizzie, who had studied with painter george hetzel and taught drawing and painting at the steubenville seminary, gave him his first art lessons. after graduating from sewickley high school in 1893 he went to new york to study under harry siddons mowbray, edwin blashfield, and kenyon cox, at the metropolitan museum of art and the art students league of new york. after further studies in europe, nicols started a career as a magazine illustrator, working for several publications including collier\\'s, mcclure\\'s, cosmopolitan, harper\\'s, scribner\\'s, st. nicholas magazine, and the burr mcintosh monthly. after a period of convalescence at home due to surgical operations, he moved into oil painting, working from a studio in the sewickley valley trust building. some of his work from this earlier period includes murals in pittsburgh public buildings and portraits. he painted civil war general alexander hays in a portrait and in a now lost painting where he is shown dragging the confederate flag from his horse. his work in oils began to get some recognition and in 1904 nicols\\' painting a reverie was accepted for the ninth carnegie international exhibition in pittsburgh. nicols began visiting the arizona desert and texas from around 1912, permanently moving with his family to el paso in 1922, due in part to health problems with an extrapulmonary tuberculosis contracted in his youth, and that made him walk with a limp. he lived in a rock house in fort boulevard at the foothills of the franklin mountains, and since before his permanent move he went on long desert expeditions for plein air painting, first in the company of two franciscan priests and later with a friend. his first work with of a desert subject was bought by breakfast cereal pioneer charles w. post in a chicago gallery, sometime between 1912 and 1914.nicols continued to paint desert panoramas of texas, arizona, new mexico, and california, and large canvas on old west subjects. his 1927 depiction of tokay, a former coal-mining settlement in socorro county, new mexico, is considered a valuable historical record of what is now a ghost town. also in 1927, a lithograph reproduction of nicols\\' painting of texas\\' el capitan peak was distributed in a publicity campaign for the texas and pacific railway. the original painting of the mountain was later placed in abilene\\'s research center for the southwest, at the hardin-simmons university library. in 1929 he was commissioned by architect henry trost to design the glass-stained mural which incorporates the painting cave creek canyon - chiricahua mountains, located at the top of the lobby stairs of the gadsden hotel in douglas, arizona. in his later life nicols was characterized as eccentric and mysterious, absorbed by his work, but he had a circle of close friends including other artists and general robert l. howze. he was married to mary olivia nicols , an irish immigrant, and had two children, audley dean jr and mary beth. in 1932 he was hospitalized for several weeks due to a brain hemorrhage but eventually recovered. he died almost ten years later in november 1941, just a few months after celebrating his daughter\\'s 10th birthday. the artist was buried in restlawn memorial park in el paso, with writer and muralist tom lea, who was also mary beth\\'s godfather, acting as one of the pallbearers. style and legacy audley dean nicols\\' style of clean, detailed landscape painting was inspired by the clarity, sharp lines and strong contrasts of the desert, and he applied techniques to capture the colors and hint at the vast expanses. nicols said in 1916:the desert is everything but gray. there are clean fresh blues, pinks and yellows in the skies, opalescent purple, rose and lavender in the ever-present distant mountains, dull greens of every shade in the vegetation, reds and yellows in the rocks and earth -but never gray.critics have recognized his depiction of the distinctive nature of desert light as one of the best. nicols\\' compositions are often organized in three horizontal sections; the desert ground and vegetation below, mountains in the middle and the sky above. he depicted vibrant nature scenes with only small traces of humans, if any, using warm light and vivid colors such as bluish purple for the distant mountains. the style and subjects of his work achieved significant popularity and were followed by other west texas artists, who collectively became known as the \"purple mountain painters\". nicols was a friend of other local el paso artists such as fremont ellis and lewis teel, and encouraged eugene thurston to start painting. nicols is considered an important early texas artist who is especially known for his large-scale portrayals of desert scenes, although he mostly depicted human subjects in his earlier work, and got an honorable mention in the 1927 san antonio wild flower competition organized by oilman and philanthropist edgar b. davis. nicols\\' work view of el paso at sunset was included in the 2019 major exhibition \"the art of texas: 250 years\" at the witte museum, san antonio. this painting was commissioned by the first national bank of el paso in 1925;

       " 'gille de vlieg (born 26 july 1940) is a photographer and anti-apartheid activist. she was born in england and moved to south africa with her mother when she was 3 years old. during apartheid she was a member of both the black sash and one of the few women members of the afrapix photography collective. her images have been published in newspapers, magazines and books nationally and internationally. unlike many of her counterparts, de vlieg received little public acclaim for her work up until recently. about her work, she says, \"i wanted to make a contribution to an alternative view of south africa, a view not seen on the south african tv screen then.\" her images cover the following topics: land removals, rural lifestyle, township lifestyle, gender lifestyle, united democratic front (udf), anti-harassment campaign, police violence, protests against death penalty, funerals, black sash, protests against incorporation into bophuthatswana; release mandela campaign, end conscription campaign (ecc), conscientious objectors, african national congress (anc) welcome home rally, day of the vow (geloftedag), street children, and homeless people. life gille de vlieg was born gillian ruth hemson in plymouth, england in 1940 during a nazi bombing raid on the city. after losing their home in a later bombing raid, she and her mother relocated to durban, south africa in february 1944. her father had been sent by the admiralty (royal navy) to work on radar installations at the simon\\'s town naval base and later on salisbury island, durban. in 1958, de vlieg was trained as a nurse at greys hospital in pietermaritzburg. after finishing her diploma, she worked in london and met her first husband, iain paton millar, a journalist. after a short period in katanga province of the drc she moved to johannesburg in 1963, where her daughters ruth and katherine were born. katherine died when nine months old and her marriage to iain disintegrated just prior to the birth of her son, andrew. she lived for a time in botha\\'s hill and durban where she met and married rob de vlieg, a sail maker. they moved back to johannesburg to set up his business in 1975. it was not until 1982 that she joined the johannesburg black sash as a volunteer and she was soon put onto their regional committee and became a vice-chairperson. it was during the height of student riots in tembisa in 1984 that gille de vlieg first made contact with greg thulare, an organiser for cosas in tembisa. she was slowly introduced to the politics of the udf and anc during this time. one of her responsibilities at black sash was to work with rural communities which were threatened with removal to the homelands, and she soon became interested in taking photos. when paul weinberg asked her to join afrapix, she replied, \"okay, i will come to work for afrapix, but i\\'m not working as a secretary, i want to be a photographer.\" she had a camera and a couple of lenses but knew very little about photography. paul weinberg taught her how to process the film and cedric nunn taught her how to print. she quickly realised she could use photography as a means of protest. the next several years she spent documenting various townships and rural areas mostly in the former transvaal. as it was then illegal for a white woman to enter the black townships, she lied to get a permit from the tembisa council and eventually was allowed into tembisa under the guise of taking pictures for anglo american. while working in tembisa, she met other members of cosas including debra marakalala, sipho (sandile) qwabe, tshepo mphuti and reuben mahlagare. trust developed between them and de vlieg. her house in the safe northern suburbs of johannesburg was often used as a hideout when the police were looking for cosas activists. in june 1986, de vlieg was arrested after a raid on her house, initially under section 50 of the internal security act, and taken to john vorster square and then to the hillbrow police station for thirty-seven days. de vlieg now lives on the kwazulu-natal north coast. photography gille de vlieg was an activist before she was a photographer, coming to photography through her work with the black sash. many of her images formed part of the afrapix monthly packages sent to various european organisations to support the fight against apartheid. the gille de vlieg photographic collection is included in the on-line south african history archive and contains 581 black and white digital images. she is also one of two women featured in beyond the barricades. in 2014 she was nominated as a finalist of the mbokodo awards. collective exhibitions 2012 - rise and fall of apartheid: photography and the bureaucracy of everyday life - international centre of photography, new york city, ny 2012 - numsa 2011 - photography 1950 - 2010 - pretoria art museum, pretoria 2009 - end conscription campaign (ecc) 2002 - shooting resistance: south african photography 1976 - 1994 - axis gallery inc., new york city, ny 1990 - malibongwe - netherlands 1989 - radda barnen - sweden 1987 - taking sides in south america - tpw - toronto photographers workshop, toronto, on 1985 - people\\'s portraits - south african national gallery individual shows 2012 - \\'hidden from view: community carers and hiv in rural south africa\\' held at the university of kwazulu-natal, produced in co-operation with amnesty international 2009 - \\'rising up together\\' at durban art gallery premiering at the national arts festival in grahamstown 2006 - \\'rising up\\' at constitution hill, johannesburg, opened by former constitutional court judge, kate o\\'regan publications vukhani makhozikazi (1985) beyond the barricades (1989) women by women: \\'50 years of women\\'s photography in south africa\\' (2006) references 1940 births living people south african photographers black sash',\n",

       " \"nashville, tennessee, has hosted minor league baseball (milb) teams since the late 19th century but has never been home to a major league baseball (mlb) team. the city's professional baseball history dates back to 1884 with the formation of the nashville americans, who were charter members of the original southern league in 1885 and played their home games at sulphur spring park, later renamed athletic park and sulphur dell. this ballpark was the home of nashville's minor league teams through 1963. of the numerous teams to play there, the best known was the nashville vols, who competed from 1901 to 1963, primarily in the southern association. following the loss of the vols and the subsequent demolition of sulphur dell, music city was without a professional baseball team for 14 years until 1978 when the nashville sounds, then a double-a team that moved up to triple-a in 1985, began play at herschel greer stadium. the sounds left greer in 2015 for first tennessee park, now known as first horizon park, a new facility built on the site of the historic sulphur dell, where they continue as the oldest active professional sports franchise in nashville. several negro league teams were based in nashville, playing at sulphur dell as well as greenwood park and tom wilson park, from 1920 to 1951. among these were the nashville elite giants, who played 15 seasons in the city, including six seasons in leagues that were retroactively granted major league status by mlb in 2020. despite efforts to bring major league baseball to nashville, most prominently in the 1993 mlb expansion process, the city has been unsuccessful in its attempts to gain a major league team. an effort is being made to either land a future expansion team or lure an existing team to nashville with the promise of a new major league facility. minor league baseball early teams (1884-1897) amateur teams first played baseball in nashville, tennessee, in the late 1860s. on october 6, 1884, local investors met to establish the city's first professional baseball team, the nashville americans. following a failed bid to join the major league union association, the americans instead became charter members of the original southern league in which they competed in 1885 and 1886. they played their home games at sulphur spring park, later renamed athletic park and sulphur dell. nashville's southern league entry in 1887 was called the nashville blues. after losing nearly us$18,000, the team's directors chose to cut their losses and withdraw from the circuit some two months before the season's end. nashville did not field another professional baseball club for the next five years until the nashville tigers joined the southern league in 1893. the tigers faced similar financial difficulties, resulting in the franchise being surrendered to the league, which continued to operate it for the remainder of their first season. their 1894 campaign came to an abrupt midseason end on the heels of league-wide financial instability. the nashville seraphs replaced the tigers in 1895. at the close of the season, the seraphs and atlanta crackers were tied for first place, and each asserted to be the rightful pennant winners. at the southern league's annual winter meeting that december, nearly four months later, nashville was declared the champion for 1895. despite winning the city's first professional baseball title, the seraphs declined to participate in 1896 when another club refused to put up its monetary guarantee to finish the season. two years later, in 1897, the nashville centennials were formed as members of the central league. financial problems necessitated the team's transfer to henderson, kentucky, just over a month into the season, and the league collapsed shortly thereafter. vols (1901-1963) the nashville vols, the city's longest-operating baseball team, played 62 seasons from 1901 to 1963. first known only as the nashville baseball club, they were formed as a charter member of the newly organized southern association in 1901. the team did not receive its official moniker, the nashville volunteers (regularly shortened to vols), until 1908. their last season in the southern association was 1961. they were inactive in 1962 due to declining attendance and the southern association ceasing operations after the 1961 season. nashville returned for a final campaign as a part of the south atlantic league in 1963. today, all minor league baseball teams are affiliated with a major league baseball team to develop players for the major league club. however, it was not until the 1930s that nashville entered into such major league affiliations on a consistent basis. the vols were affiliated with eight teams across 29 seasons and were unaffiliated in the other 33. their longest affiliation was with the chicago cubs for nine seasons (1943-1951), followed by the cincinnati reds/redlegs (8 seasons; 1936-1937, 1955-1960), new york giants (5 seasons; 1934-1935, 1952-1954), brooklyn dodgers (3 seasons; 1938-1940), and one season each with the cleveland naps (1908), minnesota twins (1961), chicago white sox (1920), and los angeles angels (1963). the vols won eight southern association pennants (1901, 1902, 1908, 1916, 1940, 1943, 1948, 1949), nine playoff championships (1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1949, 1950, 1953), and four dixie series titles (1940, 1941, 1942, 1949). sounds (1978-present) music city was without a professional baseball team for 14 years after the loss of the vols. that changed in 1978 when larry schmittou and a group of investors purchased the rights to operate an expansion franchise of the double-a southern league called the nashville sounds. the sounds played their home games at herschel greer stadium, a new ballpark located on the grounds of fort negley. nashville led all of minor league baseball in attendance in their inaugural season and continued to draw the southern league's largest crowds in each of their seven years as members of the league. the sounds had affiliations with the cincinnati reds (1978-1979) and new york yankees (1980-1984). the team won six consecutive second-half division titles from 1979 to 1984 and won the southern league championship in 1979 and 1982. in an effort to position nashville to contend for an mlb franchise in the future, schmittou and team owners purchased the triple-a evansville triplets of the american association and relocated the team to nashville before the 1985 season. the triple-a sounds carried on the history of the double-a team that preceded them. they rarely contended for the american association championship, making only three appearances in the postseason over their 13 years in the league. during this period, nashville was affiliated with the detroit tigers (1985-1986), cincinnati reds (1987-1992), and chicago white sox (1993-1997). the sounds became members of the triple-a pacific coast league in 1998 following the dissolution of the american association after the end of the previous season. they were affiliates of the pittsburgh pirates (1998-2004), milwaukee brewers (2005-2014), oakland athletics (2015-2018), and texas rangers (2019-2020). over 23 years in the league, the team qualified for the playoffs on five occasions. they won their lone pacific coast league championship in 2005. the sounds left greer stadium in 2015 for first horizon park, then known as first tennessee park, a new facility built on the site of the former sulphur dell in downtown nashville. in conjunction with major league baseball's reorganization of the minor leagues in 2021, nashville was placed in the triple-a east, which became the international league in 2022. they have been the triple-a affiliate of the milwaukee brewers since 2021. nashville has made one appearance in the international league playoffs but has not won its championship. the sounds are the oldest active professional sports franchise in nashville, predating the nashville predators (1998), tennessee titans (1999), and nashville sc (2018). xpress (1993-1994) nashville hosted two minor league teams during 1993 and 1994 seasons as the city became a temporary home to the nashville xpress, a displaced southern league team previously known as the charlotte knights. this came about after the 1992 season when charlotte, north carolina, acquired a triple-a expansion team in the international league, leaving the southern league franchise in need of a new home. larry schmittou, president of the triple-a nashville club, offered to let the displaced team play at greer stadium until a permanent home could be found. schmittou and the sounds' staff served as caretakers of the team, which was the double-a affiliate of the minnesota twins. to accommodate an additional club at greer, the xpress' home games were scheduled for during the sounds' road trips. they left nashville to play on an interim basis in wilmington, north carolina, where they were known as the port city roosters in 1995 and 1996. the franchise eventually landed in mobile, alabama, as the mobile baybears in 1997. negro leagues several negro league baseball teams hailed from nashville between 1920 and 1951. the first such club was the nashville white sox, who were charter members of the negro southern league (nsl) in 1920. they played their home games at sulphur dell. perhaps nashville's best-known negro team was the nashville elite giants, who played in the city from 1921 to 1935 as members of the negro southern league (1921-1923, 1926-1927, 1929, 1931-1932) and negro national league (nnl) (1930, 1933-1935), and also operated independently (1924-1925, 1928). the elites played at sulphur dell, greenwood park, and tom wilson park, built by team owner thomas t. wilson in 1929. wilson relocated the team to columbus, ohio, during the 1935 season, becoming the columbus elite giants. while in nashville, the team won four negro southern league championships (1921, 1922, 1929, 1931). in 2020, major league baseball retroactively granted major league status to the nnl and nsl for certain seasons, elevating the elite giants to a major league team in 1929 (as associate members of the nnl), 1930, and from 1932 to 1935. the city was home to the nashville stars of the negro major league in 1942. this team, or another bearing the same name, also competed in the nsl in 1950 and 1951 at sulphur dell. finally, the nashville black vols began playing at the dell in 1945 as members of the nsl. they became known as the nashville cubs in 1946 and split part of the 1950 season between nashville and louisville, kentucky, where they competed as the louisville cubs, before playing their final season in 1951. major league baseball though several attempts have been made to either secure membership in a major league or earn a major league baseball (mlb) expansion franchise, nashville has never had an mlb team. 1885 union association the union association, one of three major leagues in operation in 1884, considered the nashville americans for membership in its 1885 season. on october 10, president henry lucas came to nashville to meet with the team's directors and survey the prospect of major league baseball in the city. that afternoon at the nashville fairgrounds, the americans played their first exhibition game against one of the association's top teams, the cincinnati outlaw reds. the nashvilles lost both that afternoon's game and a second game the next day. with the possibility of union association membership looking dim, the americans opted instead to join the newly organized southern league in 1885. the union association disbanded before the 1885 season. 1993 mlb expansion sounds president larry schmittou, who was also vice president of marketing and administration for the texas rangers, believed in 1983 that nashville was a viable candidate to land a major league baseball team either through expansion or the relocation of an existing franchise. in november 1985, a delegation from nashville was one of 12 groups to make presentations to mlb owners and commissioner peter ueberroth regarding the viability of expansion in their cities. the delegation, which included schmittou, governor lamar alexander, and mayor richard fulton, were encouraged with their reception but were concerned that people may not know nashville well enough to make it a strong contender. the governor's commission on major league baseball entrusted schmittou and other sounds owners, including country musicians conway twitty, larry gatlin, richard sterban, jerry reed, and cal smith, with ownership of a potential franchise and responsibility for the financial requirement set forth by the expansion committee. schmittou launched a drive to pre-sell 10,000 season tickets, which was met and exceeded. in june 1990, mlb announced its intentions to add two new national league teams in a 1993 expansion. joining nashville in competition for these two spots were buffalo, new york; charlotte, north carolina; denver, colorado; miami, florida; orlando, florida; phoenix, arizona; sacramento, california; st. petersburg, florida; tampa, florida; vancouver, british columbia; and washington, d.c. schmittou gave a formal presentation to the national league expansion committee in september 1990. his plan for mlb in nashville included a proposed $40-million ballpark to be built at the convergence of interstate 24 and briley parkway that would have included a scoreboard shaped like the neck of a guitar and seated 40,000 people. along with the submission of a 120-page proposal, the committee was shown a video narrated by country music hall of fame member eddy arnold, which extolled the suitability of nashville for a major league team. on december 18, the committee released a short list of six finalist candidates—nashville was not included on the list. the two new franchises were eventually awarded to denver (the colorado rockies) and miami (the florida marlins). 1998 mlb expansion after the failed 1993 expansion bid, schmittou felt that the lack of a major league stadium significantly hurt nashville's mlb viability. he intended to reapply in the next round of expansion if a plan for a stadium was in place. having no such plan for a ballpark by the august 11, 1994, deadline for application for the 1998 mlb expansion, schmittou did not apply. the nashville sports council requested an application from the expansion committee but did not complete and return the packet. franchises were awarded to phoenix (the arizona diamondbacks) and tampa bay (the tampa bay devil rays). future expansion major league baseball has not announced plans regarding future expansion. it wants to see the oakland athletics and tampa bay rays find replacement ballparks for their aging facilities before expanding to 32 teams. still, nashville has been one of several cities mentioned by commissioner rob manfred as potential locations for expansion when that should happen. the city has also been mentioned as a possible relocation site for either the oakland or tampa bay franchises. in january 2019, businessman john loar announced plans to spearhead the next attempt at bringing an mlb expansion franchise to nashville. he subsequently formed music city baseball to pursue this plan. the group includes loar, former united states attorney general alberto gonzales, vanderbilt commodores baseball head coach tim corbin, retired mlb pitcher dave stewart, manager tony la russa, executive dave dombrowski, musicians justin timberlake and darius rucker, and former tennessee titan eddie george. in april 2022, stewart was appointed to lead music city baseball. key difficulties facing the proposal include a lack of capital funds to build a ballpark and pay an mlb enfranchisement fee, obtaining the land on which to build when mayor john cooper has said the city will not pay for the facility, and the presence of the nashville sounds. the nashville baseball territory is controlled by the sounds, so music city baseball would have to buy them out. sounds co-owner frank ward has said he would relocate his team if mlb came to nashville rather than try to coexist in the same market. this leads to the problem of what to do with the sounds' first horizon park, which is owned by the city and will not be paid off until 2043. additionally, they had planned to build a privately-funded stadium on city-owned land on the east bank of the cumberland river between nissan stadium and korean veterans boulevard, but the tennessee titans of the national football league and mayor cooper reached a tentative deal in october 2022 to build a new football stadium on the site. the initial announcement of this plan led the group to consider building instead on the campus of tennessee state university in west nashville. if an expansion team was awarded to the group, it would be called the nashville stars in homage to the negro leagues and the team of the same name that hailed from nashville. the group entered into a licensing agreement with the negro leagues baseball museum, which includes revenue sharing, a potential physical location in their ballpark, and the rights to use the stars' name and related photographs and artifacts. see also list of baseball parks in nashville,

       " 'plano-convex ingots are lumps of metal with a flat or slightly concave top and a convex base. they are sometimes, misleadingly, referred to as bun ingots which imply the opposite concavity. they are most often made of copper, although other materials such as copper alloy, lead and tin are used. the first examples known were from the near east during the 3rd and 2nd millennia bc. by the end of the bronze age they were found throughout europe and in western and south asia. similar ingot forms continued in use during later roman and medieval periods. manufacture traditionally bun ingots were seen as a primary product of smelting, forming at the base of a furnace beneath a layer of less dense slag. however, experimental reconstruction of copper smelting showed that regular plano-convex ingots are difficult to form within the smelting furnace, producing only small ingots or copper prills that need to be remelted. high purity copper bun ingots found in late bronze age britain and the mediterranean seem to have undergone a secondary refining procedure. the metallographic structure and high iron compositions of some plano-convex ingots suggest that they are the product of primary smelting. tylecote suggested that roman plano-convex copper ingots may have been formed by tapping both slag and copper in one step into a mould or pit outside the furnace. a similar process was described by agricola in book ix of his de re metallica and has been replicated experimentally. structure although all bun ingots share the same basic morphology, the details of their form and the texture of their convex base is dependent on the mould in which they cooled. bun ingots made in purpose-dug depressions in sand can be highly variable in form even on the same site, whereas ingots cast in reusable moulds will form sets of identical \"mould siblings\". the composition of the metal and its cooling conditions affect structure. as the ingot cools gases are released giving the upper surface a \"blistered\" texture and if cooling takes place outside of the furnace, the outer surface often becomes oxidised. casting in a warm mould or reheating furnace gives the ingot an even columnar structure running in the direction of cooling, whereas ingots cast in a cold mould have a distinctive two stage cooling structure with an outer chilled layer reflecting the rapid cooling of the bottom when it came into contact with the mould. a slightly concave upper surface can be produced if the top of the ingot cools more slowly than the bottom. britain late bronze age by the late bronze age, the copper bun ingot, either in a simple form or with a hole in its center, had become the main form of copper ingot, replacing the earlier ‘bar ingot\\' or rippenbarre. weights of complete examples average ~4 kg, but examples of up to about 7 kg are known. many early finds of british lba bun ingots were unstratified but recently bun-shaped ingots and ingot fragments have been found in hoards alongside bronze artifacts and scrap metal. several offshore finds of probable lba date suggest that copper bun ingots may have been traded by sea during this period. composition and structure the copper is of high purity, although earlier examples are sometimes composed of arsenical copper. tylecote suggested that they are not primary smelting products and instead were refined and recast. the macrostructure of a half section example from gillan, cornwall shows a columnar structure that probably indicates slow cooling in a reheating furnace or a warm mold, rather than from pouring into a cold mold. iron age and roman period a second major group of british bun ingots date to the roman period and are found mostly in the copper-rich highland areas of wales and in scotland. they are heavier than the lba examples, with weights ranging between 12 and 22 kg. some have stamps clearly dating them to the roman period including an example that reads socio romae natsol. the term \"socio\" suggests that the ingots were cast by a private company rather than by the state. fraser hunter reassessed the context of the scottish examples and some of the unstamped welsh examples and argues that they could in fact date to the iron age or at least reflect native rather than roman copper working. although ingots of any sort are not common in the british iron age, planoconvex or bun-shaped ingots exist, e.g. a tin ingot discovered within the iron age hillfort at chun castle, cornwall. composition and structure of roman ingots the roman bun ingots are less pure than the earlier lba examples and tylecote suggests that they may be a direct product of smelting. theoretically such an ingot could be formed in the base of the furnace. however, this is problematic in the case of the stamped examples as this would require the furnace to be dismantled or else have a short shaft to allow access for stamping. as a solution the furnace could have been tapped into a mould at the completion of smelting. it is possible that both methods were used as several of the ingots seem to have had additional metal poured onto the top in order to allow stamping. references

       " 'derek william dick (born 25 april 1958), better known by his stage name fish, is a scottish singer-songwriter and occasional actor. fish became widely known as the lead singer and lyricist of the neo-progressive rock band marillion from 1981 until 1988. he released 11 uk top 40 singles with the band, including the top ten singles \"kayleigh\", \"lavender\" and \"incommunicado\", and five top ten albums, including a number one with misplaced childhood. in his solo career, fish explored contemporary pop and traditional folk, and released a further five top 40 singles and a top 10 album. fish\\'s voice has been described as both \"distinct\" and a \"conflation of roger daltrey and peter gabriel\", while his lyrics have been described as \"poetic prose\". in 2004, classic rock ranked fish at number 49 on its list of \"the 100 greatest frontmen\", describing his \"theatrical delivery\" as \"a major factor in marillion\\'s spectacular rise, and he masterminded some uniquely ornate lyrical concepts.\" in 2009, fish was voted at number 37 in a poll of the greatest voices in rock music by planet rock listeners. in 2020, fish released his final studio album weltschmerz (german for \"world-weariness\"), to critical acclaim and commercial success. fish toured weltschmerz and celebrated the 30th anniversary of a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors as part of the vigil\\'s end tour in 2021. fish plans to retire following a farewell tour in 2024. early life derek william dick was born on 25 april 1958 in edinburgh, scotland, and grew up in dalkeith. the son of robert and isabella, fish was educated at king\\'s park primary school and then dalkeith high school. he was inspired by the music of many of the rock artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including genesis, pink floyd, the moody blues, the kinks, t. rex, david bowie, argent, and the sensational alex harvey band (fish would later pay tribute to these early influences on his covers album songs from the mirror). fish has also cited canadian singer-songwriter joni mitchell as \"one of the biggest influences on me because of her approach to lyrics\". the first band he saw live was yes at usher hall, edinburgh, in 1974. as well as his love for music, he was also a voracious reader, and his literary inspirations included jack kerouac, truman capote, robert burns and dylan thomas (all of whom would later be depicted on the sleeve of marillion\\'s clutching at straws). fish worked as a petrol pump attendant, gardener, and from 1977 until 1980 worked in forestry at the bowhill estate in selkirk. while living in fochabers, moray he adopted the nickname of fish, which originated from a landlord who lamented the amount of time he spent in the bath. fish has been quoted: \"with a real name of derek william dick, it became very necessary to find a nickname as quickly as possible.\" he first performed as a singer in 1980: \"the very first gig i ever did as a singer was in gala [galashiels] in the golden lion pub.\" he moved to church laneham, nottinghamshire, in mid-1980 following a successful audition for the stone dome band, and then to aylesbury at the start of 1981 in the process of joining marillion. marillion fish joined marillion in 1981. the band gained popularity over the next couple of years, leading to the release of their top-ten debut album script for a jester\\'s tear in 1983. they achieved further chart success in the uk, attaining top-ten hit singles in 1985 with \"kayleigh\" and \"lavender\", and again in 1987 with \"incommunicado\". in 1988, due to the stress of touring and the detrimental effect it was having on his health, as well as having a falling out with bandmate steve rothery, fish left marillion to pursue a solo career. lyrics from \"kayleigh\" were etched into paving stones in market square in galashiels in 2012. the lines \"stilettoes in the snow\", and \"moon-washed college halls\" were inspired by fish\\'s girlfriend of the time, who was at the scottish college of textiles in galashiels in the 1980s. solo career fish\\'s debut solo album vigil in a wilderness of mirrors was released in january 1990. although the recordings for the album finished in june 1989, emi records decided to delay the release until 1990, to avoid collision with marillion\\'s album seasons end, released in september 1989. keyboardist mickey simmonds who had played with mike oldfield, co-wrote the songs on the album, and would continue to play with fish on the tour. also guitarist janick gers co-wrote the track \"view from the hill\". several well known musicians contributed to the album, including former dire straits guitarist hal lindes, who played guitar on most tracks and also contributed to the writing of three of the album\\'s songs. frank usher, a fish companion from pre-marillion times, also contributed. drums were played by mark brzezicki (big country) and john keeble (spandau ballet), john giblin contributed bass and luís jardim contributed additional percussion. backing vocals came from tessa niles, who had appeared on clutching at straws. many of fish\\'s later works contain lengthy spoken-word lyrics, shorter examples of which can be heard on earlier marillion albums. he has collaborated with genesis founder tony banks on banks\\'s still and soundtracks albums, singing on the tracks \"shortcut to somewhere\", \"angel face\" and \"another murder of a day\", co-writing the latter. his solo career has never received the same recognition or attention, and to a lot of people he went missing soon after the vigil in a wilderness of mirrors album, in february 1990, the album peaked at number 5 in the uk albums chart. after finishing the vigil world tour at royal albert hall on 9 july 1990, fish was to enter litigation with emi records resulting in a high court injuction that stopped him releasing new music for almost a year. the extensive touring cost him dearly and the decision to go ahead with building a new studio in his home in haddington scotland meant that funds were rapidly depleted along with his confidence and his creative energies. the prospect of writing the follow-up for the new label, polydor, filled him with dread. his second album internal exile released in october 1991, was flirting with styles but never got into a particular groove and locking into a direction. the album\\'s music reflected fish\\'s indulgence in the vast regions of music that he wanted to explore as a solo artist; most notably celtic music and folk styles. the acquisition of chris kimsey as producer could not save the project as he attempted to come to terms with a newly built studio and fish plauged by bitterness and cynicism toward the industry. polydor had rushed the album out with his acquiesence resulted in a fractured promotion campaign and low sales, and the uk promoter went bankrupt just as the tour was about to kick off. polydor wanted a new studio album but fish persisted and he decided to release an album of cover versions called songs from the mirror. produced by james cassidy, whom fish met while both were working on jeff waynes spartacus album. they started recording in summer 1992 while simultaneously writing material for the next studio album suits, a cynical examination lyrically of the music business and executives who still fed fish\\'s cynical outlook on life. songs from the mirror, released in january 1993, became the last album on polydor. but the album was a turning point for fish, and fully prepared him for the suits sessions, material which he had been rehearsing constantly on tour as he struggled to pay bills and musicians. fish formed his own record company, dick bros. after advice from a medium who passed on messages from his grandfather. the co. was namned after the garage business he had started and fish\\'s father had run throuhout his childhood. the first release was sushi, a live album to follow the five official bootleg releases, on battleside, a company that temporarily filled the gap between polydor and dick bros., and provided fish with a lifeline and a quality alternative to the illegal live bootlegs that had followed his career. his confidence had grown and was excited about the new songs on suits released in 1994, some of which were co-written by james cassidy who had stayed on since producing the songs from the mirror album to assist with his classical training and expertise with arrangements. it proved invaluable and together with his awareness and experience with modern production techniques the material was guaranteed to enter a new direction and to gain a momentum that would usher the solo career into a new era. touring took precedent and fish was well aware that road work was at the expense of writing a new studio album. he went for the break and opted for the two \"best of\\'s\", yin and yang, containing re-recorded material from the marillion era and solo albums, to give fish the fuel and introduction to countries he had never managed to reach so far with his career. released in 1995 these albums allowed him to stay on the road for nearly two years plugging away and hoping for the breakthrough that would give him the space to take a breath and write new material. it never happened until 1997 when, after a tour in bosnina, playing to the un troops he reached the stage where he had to get experiences out and onto paper. fish was introduced to steven wilson, who although sympathetic to the progressive rock genre, had no intention of getting involved in a regressive album, which suited fish fine and welcomed wilson\\'s influence with open ears. the writing sessions were open and new songs and approaches were generated from a healthy friction between wilson and fish as they fought for their identities in the material. grooves and loops led the rhythmic foundations into what they described as \"progressive nouveaux\", still retaining the drama and tension associated with fish\\'s previous work, but taking it into a more modern setting with a new edge and aggression. with calum malcolm\\'s mix and elliot ness engineering skills provided a technical quality to match the standard of the writing on sunsets on empire. but once again the problem of underfunded promotion and advertising was to foil fish\\'s plans and a 115 date tour in 22 different countries was set up to attempt to give the album the attention it deserved. seven months after its release the tour ground to an exhausted conclusion in december 1997. with a combination of tour losses and bad debts from third parties, fish could no longer survive as an independent artist releasing his albums through dick bros. he was effectively broke and financing the recording of the album raingods with zippos were beyond his means. fish was asked to take part in a writing retreat in france by miles copeland. together with 23 songwriters from all over the world, fish rediscovered himself and when he returned with new songs he was exited and eager to get on with the job of redefining his career, and writing the rest of the new album. three songs were taken from the sessions in france for the set up for raingods with zippos, together with a 25-minute epic called \"plague of ghosts\" written together with tony turrell and mark daghorn featuring steven wilson on guitar, and two tracks written with his old friend mickey simmonds. raindgods with zippos was released by roadrunner records in april 1999. the raingods album is often hailed as one of fish\\'s greatest solo achievements along with his 1990 debut. in may 2001, fish released his first studio album on his new independent label the chocolate frog record company, fellini days, which fish co-wrote with john wesley and john young. field of crows was fish\\'s eighth solo studio album originally released in december 2003 and then to retail in may 2004. the album was mainly co-written with bruce watson and irvin duguid. fish appeared at world bowl xi, 14 june 2003, hampden park, glasgow. his performance included a rousing rendition of \"caledonia\" before kick-off. in 2005, he won a celebrity music edition of the weakest link, beating eggsy of goldie lookin chain in the final round, sharing £18,750 with eggsy\\'s charity and his own. on 26 august 2007, fish performed at the \\'hobble on the cobbles\\' show at the market square in aylesbury. he was accompanied on stage by his four former marillion bandmates from the classic line-up (mark kelly, steve rothery, ian mosley and pete trewavas) for one song: \"market square heroes\". this was the first time they had performed together in nearly two decades. in a press interview following the event, fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, claiming that \"hogarth does a great job with the band ... we forged different paths over the 19 years.\" his album 13th star was released on 12 september 2007 as a specially packaged pre-release version available to order from his website. a uk tour for this album commenced in march 2008, supported by glyder. in february 2008, fish was confirmed to be the friday-night headline act at nearfest x. he also appeared with bbc radio 2\\'s bob harris on gmtv to promote childline rocks, a charity concert. in 2008, fish presented a friday evening radio show, fish on friday, for digital radio station planet rock. when the station was faced with closure, malcolm bluemel (with the help of fish, tony iommi, ian anderson and gary moore) helped save planet rock by buying the station. on 9 june 2008, fish embarked on his first full north american tour in eleven years. at each stop, he hosted a pre-show meet-and-greet with his fans. on 20 and 21 october 2012, fish hosted fish convention 2012 in leamington spa. he performed two acoustic sets and two electric sets, including material from his then upcoming studio album, a feast of consequences. he also performed \"grendel\", a fan-favourite marillion b-side, twice. a feast of consequences was released in september 2013 to positive reviews, supported by the single \"blind to the beautiful\". fish celebrated the 30th anniversary of the marillion album clutching at straws on tour in 2018, alongside debuting material from his then upcoming studio album weltschmerz. a three track ep, a parley with angels, was released in september 2018. in april 2020, fish revived his fish on friday show in the form of a weekly live video podcast, initially broadcast on facebook (later simulcast on facebook, youtube and twitter). created during the covid-19 pandemic to keep in touch with his fans and share stories from his career, the show was voted as the event of the year by prog magazine readers in 2021. fish on friday remains active as of 2023, with new episodes of the show broadcast weekly. in september 2020, fish released weltschmerz, his final studio album. the album was supported by the singles \"weltschmerz\", \"garden of remembrance\" and \"this party\\'s over\". the album received positive reviews and was commercially successful, having sold over 60,000 copies to date. fish toured weltschmerz and celebrated the 30th anniversary of a vigil in a wilderness of mirrors as part of the vigil\\'s end tour in 2021. the tour was documented on the live album vigil\\'s end tour 2021, released on physical formats in december 2022 and digitally in march 2023. musical style fish has sometimes been compared to peter gabriel, original lead singer of genesis in the early 1970s, and his voice has even been described as \"uncannily close\". music journalist david hepworth described his voice as a \"conflation of roger daltrey and peter gabriel\". fish has acknowledged gabriel\\'s influence on him and some vocal similarities, but has rejected accusations from some critics during his career that he does not have a unique voice of his own. peter hammill of van der graaf generator was also a major influence on his songwriting and vocal delivery, which is especially notable on the first two marillion albums. in 2018, fish told planet rock, \"i don\\'t look at myself as a singer, i\\'m not a technically gifted singer. i think one of the problems i had was back in the early eighties i was singing very wrong, very unnatural. i think if i\\'d gone to see a voice coach at that point in my life they\\'d have said \\'stop singing like that because you will not be able to keep that going for the rest of your life.\\'\" record labels following a legal dispute with emi records and an unsuccessful contract with polydor, fish established the dick bros record company in haddington in 1993. the studio recorded in amber by dream disciples (1994) and man dancin by tam white in (1996). he released a number of \"official bootleg\" albums to finance the company before selling it to roadrunner records. another financially unsuccessful period followed before he re-established his own chocolate frog records label in 2001. he signed with snapper music in 2005, but later returned to chocolate frog records. after having his own independent record company in the 1990s which charted a number of releases, fish decided not to sign up to the official chart company when he released weltschmerz, an album self-funded, marketed and distributed from his home in scotland. as fish did not partner with a record label as per chart rules and regulations, he missed out on a top ten chart placing when early sales revealed that he would have been number 2 on the uk midweek charts behind that week\\'s chart topper, the independent band idles. awards in may 2008, fish\\'s planet rock show fish on friday won the silver award in the music broadcaster of the year category at the uk sony radio academy awards 2008. in june 2008, at the new york festivals radio broadcasting awards, he and gary moore jointly received the gold world medal in the regularly scheduled music programme category for their respective shows on planet rock. acting fish was offered and accepted a part in the 1986 film highlander (for which marillion were also offered the soundtrack) but he eventually had to turn it down, owing to his tour commitments with the band. fish first appeared on terrestrial television as himself in the \"more bad news\" episode of the series the comic strip presents... in 1988. his first acting role was as a guest star in an episode of zorro called \"the newcomers\" (aired 10 february 1991) but a more prominent role was as the thug ferguson alongside john sessions in jute city, a four-part 1991 bbc drama based on a group of masonic ruffians. in 1994, he appeared in chasing the deer, a film set during the 1745 jacobite rebellion, as angus cameron. he also missed out on a role in braveheart. he spent two days with mel gibson in london who kept asking him to be involved but he was committed to touring his suits album instead. in 1998, he appeared as david lawson in series 14, episode 44 of the itv series the bill, titled \"manhunt\" and was aired on 16 april. he played derek trout, a record producer in the 1998 series, the young person\\'s guide to becoming a rock star. he appeared as barry judd in a 2000 episode of the tv detective series rebus alongside john hannah. later that year he appeared in episode number 48, \"skin deep\", of the

       " 'the safe sidewalk vending act is a 2018 california law decriminalizing street vending and legalizing street vending under certain conditions. the purpose of sb 946 is to decriminalize and legalize street vending throughout the state. the proposal defines \"sidewalk vendor\" as a person who sells merchandise or food from a pushcart, stand, display, pedal-driven cart, wagon, showcase, rack, or other non-motorized conveyance on a sidewalk or pedestrian path. sb 946 states a vendor can be a \"roaming sidewalk vendor\", which is someone who moves around to vend, or a \"stationary vendor\", someone who just stays in one place to vend. sb 946 applies to charter cities in terms of local authority. the purpose of sb 946 is to let local law enforcement not fine or regulate street vendors where sidewalk traffic is light and is not infringing upon activity within the area. if local authorities wish to regulate sidewalk vending, they have to be consistent with sb 946. if a city does not have any sidewalk vending legislations and wishes to implement new ones, they also have to be consistent with sb 946. if local authorities have regulations that are consistent with sb 946, no further action is needed. if they have regulations that are not consistent with sb 946, adjustments to these laws will have to be adjusted. any sidewalk vending regulations that are adopted or enforced by local authority must follow specific standards \"sb 946 also imposes time, place, and manner restrictions on sidewalk street vending.\" a local authority is not required to enforce all or some of these restrictions. if any additional restrictions other than the ones above are to be enforced, it must be directly related to objective health, safety, or welfare concerns. \"sb 946 allows but does not require a permitting program for local sidewalk vendors.\" these programs must accept specific id documents in lieu of a social security number. the collected number is confidential. sb 946 does not limit or affect any state food safety laws, including the california retail food code. sb 946 does not allow any criminal charges, but may allow administrative fines. a violation of the local authority\\'s vending programs is only punishable by the following fines: $100 for the first violation, $200 for the second violation, and $500 for any additional violation within one year of the first violation. if the local authority requires a vending program, the authorities can impose higher fines for vending without a permit: $250 for the first violation, $500 for the second violation, and $1000 for any additional violation within one year of the first violation. on the fourth and any subsequent violation, the local authority can rescind a permit. sb 946 applies to any pending criminal charges or vindicates any prior convictions. controversy vendor cooperation while the intent of sb 946 is to aid in the \"important entrepreneurship and economic development opportunities\" street vending may bring to low-income and immigrant communities, the inability to prosecute vendors with criminal charges has led to issues surrounding vendor cooperation. despite the passing of city ordinances that require vendors to receive permits and follow certain regulations, some vendors \"have chosen to ignore these regulations and bypass the permitting program\". a lack of vendor cooperation has led some cities to create stricter ordinances in hopes of gaining compliance through larger fines, relocations, or confiscation of \"stalls and wares\". health permit in many california cities, the permitting process required of vendors may also include receiving a food handler health permit, a document certifying the safe preparation of food by vendors. outdated state retail food code however has caused issues for vendors seeking to comply with these regulations. in an effort to solve this issue, senate bill 972 was passed by the california senate in order to update the food code to simplify the requirements for street vendors. specifically, the bill introduces street vending into the food code and limits the equipment requirements originally established for food trucks. references further reading street vendors california statutes',\n",

       " 'siraj-ud-daulah (born mirza muhammad siraj ud-daulah; ; 1733 - 2 july 1757) was the last independent nawab of bengal, reigning from 1756 to 1757. the end of his reign marked the beginning of the rule of the east india company over bengal and later almost all of the indian subcontinent. siraj ascended to the masnad on 9 april 1756, following the death of his maternal grandfather, alivardi khan, at the age of 23. betrayed by mir jafar, the commander of nawab\\'s army, siraj lost the battle of plassey on 23 june 1757. the forces of the east india company under robert clive invaded and the administration of bengal fell into the hands of the company. siraj-ud-daulah attempted to escape, but mir jafar seized him and brought him to his residence. he held the nawab by the waist and captured him, siraj was executed on 2 july 1757. early life siraj was born to the family of mirza muhammad hashim and amina begum in 1733. soon after his birth, alivardi khan, siraj\\'s maternal grandfather, was appointed the deputy governor of bihar. amina begum was the youngest daughter of alivardi khan and princess sharfunnisa, the paternal aunt of mir jafar. his father, mirza muhammad hashim was the youngest son of haji ahmad, the elder brother of alivardi khan. siraj\\'s great-grandfather was mirza muhammad madani, who was of either of arab or turkic ancestry, the son of a foster-brother of the mughal emperor aurangzeb; madani himself began his career as a cup-bearer under the latter\\'s son azam shah. his great-grandmother belonged to the turkic afshar tribe of khorasan. through her, he was a grandnephew of shuja-ud-din muhammad khan, the two having shared a common ancestor in nawab aqil khan. siraj was regarded as the \"fortune child\" of the family. he received the special affection of his grandfather and was raised at the nawab\\'s palace with all necessary education and training suitable for a future nawab. young siraj also accompanied alivardi on his military ventures against the marathas in 1746. in 1750, siraj revolted against his grandfather and seized patna, but quickly surrendered and was forgiven. in may 1752, alivardi declared siraj as his successor. the former died on 9 april 1756. reign as nawab siraj ud-daulah\\'s nomination to the nawab ship aroused the jealousy and enmity of his maternal aunt, ghaseti begum (mehar un-nisa begum), mir jafar, jagat seth (mehtab chand) and shaukat jang (siraj\\'s cousin). ghaseti begum possessed huge wealth, which was the source of her influence and strength. apprehending serious opposition from her, siraj ud-daulah seized her wealth from motijheel palace and placed her under confinement. the nawab also made changes in high government positions by giving them to his own favourites. mir madan was appointed bakshi (paymaster of the army) in place of mir jafar. mohanlal was elevated to the rank of peshkar (court-clerk) of his dewan-khane and he exercised great influence in the administration. eventually, siraj suppressed shaukat jang, governor of purnia, who was killed in a clash. black hole of calcutta during this period, the british east india company was increasing their influence in the indian subcontinent, particularly in bengal; siraj soon grew to resent the politico-military presence of the east india company in bengal. in particular, he was angered at the company\\'s alleged involvement with and instigation of some members of his own court to a conspiracy to oust him. his charges against the company were broadly threefold. firstly, that they strengthened the fortification around the fort william without any intimation or approval; secondly, that they grossly abused trade privileges granted them by the mughal rulers - which caused heavy loss of customs duties for the government; and thirdly, that they gave shelter to some of his officers, for example, krishnadas, son of rajballabh, who fled dhaka after misappropriating government funds. hence, when the east india company began further enhancement of military strength at fort william in calcutta, siraj ud-daulah ordered them to stop. the company did not heed his directives; consequently, siraj retaliated and captured calcutta (for a short while renamed alinagar) from the british in june 1756. the nawab gathered his forces together and took fort william. more than 100 british captives were placed in the prison cell as a temporary holding by a local commander. the captives were left overnight, with the temperature as high as 40 °c, in the 14 ft by 18 ft cell (5.4 m by 4.2 m) which was originally intended for petty criminals. they were jeered when they begged to be released. all but 23 died of suffocation, heat, or trampling. downfall popular discontent against the nawab flourished in his own court. the seths, the traders of bengal, were in perpetual fear for their wealth under the reign of siraj, contrary to the situation under alivardi\\'s reign. according to ghulam hussain khan, siraj had physically assaulted the seth and threatened to circumcise him. they had engaged yar lutuf khan to defend them in case they were threatened in any way. william watts, the company representative at the court of siraj, informed clive about a conspiracy at the court to overthrow the ruler. the conspirators included mir jafar, the paymaster of the army, rai durlabh, yar lutuf khan and omichund (amir chand), a sikh merchant, and several officers in the army. when communicated in this regard by mir jafar, clive referred it to the select committee in calcutta on 1 may. the committee passed a resolution in support of the alliance. a treaty was drawn up between the british and mir jafar to raise him to the throne of the nawab in return for support to the british in the field of battle and the bestowal of large sums of money upon them as compensation for the attack on calcutta. on 2 may, clive broke up his camp and sent half the troops to calcutta and the other half to chandernagar. mir jafar and the seths desired that the confederacy between the british and himself be kept secret from omichund, but when he found out about it, he threatened to betray the conspiracy if his share was not increased to three million rupees (£300,000). hearing of this, clive suggested an expedient to the committee. he suggested that two treaties be drawn - the real one on white paper, containing no reference to omichund and the other on red paper, containing omichund\\'s desired stipulation, to deceive him. the members of the committee signed on both treaties, but admiral watson signed only the real one and his signature had to be counterfeited on the fictitious one. both treaties and separate articles for donations to the army, navy squadron and committee were signed by mir jafar on 4 june. lord clive testified and defended himself thus before the house of commons of parliament on 10 may 1773, during the parliamentary inquiry into his conduct in india: battle of plassey the battle of plassey (or palashi) is widely considered the turning point in the history of the subcontinent, marking the start of british rule in india. after siraj-ud-daulah\\'s conquest of calcutta, the british sent fresh troops from madras to recapture the fort and avenge the attack. a retreating siraj-ud-daulah met the british at plassey. he had to make camp 27 miles away from murshidabad. on 23 june 1757 siraj-ud-daulah called on mir jafar because he was saddened by the sudden fall of mir mardan who was a very dear companion of siraj in battles. the nawab asked for help from mir jafar. mir jafar advised siraj to retreat for that day. the nawab made the blunder in giving the order to stop the fight. following his command, the soldiers of the nawab were returning to their camps. at that time, robert clive attacked the soldiers with his army. at such a sudden attack, the army of siraj became undisciplined and could think of no way to fight. much of the army retreated, betrayed by a conspiracy plotted by jagat seth, mir jafar, krishna chandra and omichund among other; siraj lost the battle and had to escape. he rode away and went first to murshidabad, specifically to heerajheel or motijheel, his palace at mansurganj. he ordered his principal commanders to engage their troops for his safety, but as he was bereft of power due to the loss at plassey, they were reluctant to offer unquestioning support. some advised him to deliver himself up to the english, but siraj equated this with treachery. others proposed he should encourage the army with greater rewards, and this he seemed to approve of. yet the numbers in his retinue were considerably diminished. soon he dispatched most of the women of his harem to purneah, under the protection of mohanlal, with gold and elephants. then, with his principal consort lutf-un-nisa and very few attendants, siraj began his escape towards patna by boat, but mir jafar\\'s soldiers reached the spot and seized him. they held siraj by the waist and captured him. they brought him back to the palace and locked him in the prison. death mir jafar held siraj-ud-daulah by the waist and dragged him out of the prison. he tied siraj by a waist chain and brought him forcibly to namak haram deorhi on 2 july 1757. siraj-ud-daulah was executed on 2 july 1757 by mohammad ali beg under orders from mir miran, son of mir jafar in namak haram deorhi as part of the agreement between mir jafar and the british east india company. siraj-ud-daulah\\'s tomb is located at khushbagh, murshidabad. it is marked with a simple but elegant one-storied mausoleum, surrounded by gardens. criticism siraj ud-daulah has gained a positive reputation in india, bangladesh, and pakistan for his opposition to the beginning of british rule over india. in 1985, sarkar wrote: after the death of alivardi khan, his immature grandson became the nawab of bengal, taking the name mirza mohammed siraj-ud-daula. in addition to his young age, he had many kinds of defects in his character and conduct. historian sushil chaudhary argued that siraj ud-daula\\'s villainous character is a misrepresentation. legacy the end of siraj ud-daulah\\'s reign also ended bengali autonomy and marked the beginning of british power in india. in the bengali version of the end of his rule, mir jafar and robert clive are the villains and siraj is the victim. even though he is rarely if ever depicted as an attractive person, he is regarded as having been sinned against, rather than as a sinner. as the movement for indian independence gathered strength, siraj along with tipu sultan and the heroes of the first war of indian independence including the last mughal emperor, bahadur shah ii, gained iconic status as people who resisted the imperial aggression. siraj\\'s legacy has become the subject of cultural war between those who want to offer some moral defense for western imperialism as a civilizing mission and those who see the colonial period as one in which the strong exploited the weak, and reject the contention that europe had much to offer india in terms of culture or that europeans conducted themselves in a morally superior way. namesakes siraj ud daula college, karachi, pakistan nawab siraj-ud-daulah government college, natore, bangladesh

his mother and siblings worked on the family farm. jones was the fifth of six children, with four brothers and a sister. he attended north carolina central university in durham, north carolina, and became a member of the kappa alpha psi fraternity there, before graduating with a b.a. in business administration in 1983. jones also completed the john f. kennedy school of government\\'s executive program. jones began his career in the telecommunications industry, first working with mci communications (which later became mci inc.) and later bellsouth corporation. at bellsouth, he was part of a team that established wireless communications in montevideo, uruguay. jones has served on the dekalb board of health, the atlanta regional commission, the dekalb library board, the dekalb pension board, and the board of visitors for emory university and north carolina central university. political career georgia house of representatives jones was elected to the georgia house of representatives in 1992, representing district sh 071, succeeding sidney pope jones jr. jones served from 1993 to 2001, during which time he was a member of the appropriations committee, the insurance committee, and the health & ecology committee, as well as the banking committee, and a special judiciary committee. jones also chaired the chairman of the health professions subcommittee. among the proposals jones sponsored or co-sponsored in the georgia house was a bill to remove the confederate battle flag emblem from georgia state flag, and a bill that would have banned minors from purchasing music with explicit lyrics. jones did not stand for reelection in 2000, instead running for dekalb county ceo, and was succeeded in the georgia house by ron sailor. dekalb county ceo jones was elected as chief executive officer of dekalb county, georgia, in 2000, winning 64% of the vote, and was re-elected in 2004 with 54% of the vote. jones is the first african american to serve as ceo of the county. in april 2001, shortly after jones became ceo, he voted, along with five other dekalb county commissioners, to offer life and health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of gay and unmarried county employees. dekalb was the first county in georgia to offer such benefits. during his administration, dekalb county established the first local homeland security office in 2001. he requested and received congressional designation of arabia mountain as a national heritage area. jones was also primarily responsible for creation of dekalb county\\'s first economic development department, which generated $4 billion in new investments. however, jones\\'s term as dekalb county ceo was also known for controversies and accusations of improprieties. shortly after taking office jones went back on his campaign pledge to keep the homestead exemption sales tax in place. he was criticized for vetoing pay raises for police officers. in january 2005, the georgia state ethics commission sanctioned jones for campaign contribution limit violations in his 2004 reelection campaign. under a consent order, jones returned all excess contributions and personally paid a $7,500 civil penalty. jones apologized and stated that changes in campaign finance laws between the initial election and the run-off election were the reason for his acceptance of nineteen improper campaign contributions. he was initially accused of illegally using campaign funds to promote the 2005 bond referendum, but the state ethics commission \"found no reasonable grounds\" for the complaint. 2008 united states senate campaign jones ran for the u.s. senate in 2008, but was defeated 60% to 40% in the 2008 run-off for georgia\\'s democratic u.s. senate primary. on march 23, 2007, jones announced he was running for the united states senate against incumbent republican saxby chambliss. jones was criticized by his chief rival jim martin over his more conservative politics and past support for george w. bush. jones\\' campaign was also marred by two new controversies. jones sent out a flier in which he appeared in a digitally altered picture next to democratic presidential candidate barack obama with the words \"yes we can.\" however, obama himself stated he not only never posed with jones, he did not endorse jones or any other candidate for the democratic nomination for senate. in response, jones blamed his \"liberal opponents backed by the liberal media\" for trying to ruin his campaign. jones was also criticized for the appearance of the tagline \"vote vernon jones for ga senate\" on tickets, produced using county funds, for the dekalb county blues and jazz festival. the company who printed the tickets, supporters of jones\\' campaign, took responsibility for the incident; saying that they were unaware campaign finance laws made such an action illegal. in the july 15, 2008 democratic primary election, jones won a plurality of votes in the democratic primary. however, georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face one another in a runoff. on august 5, 2008, jones lost the run-off election to jim martin by a margin of 20 points. jones unexpectedly lost to martin in his home base of dekalb county. jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head-to-head match up against martin. the black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting jones\\' chances in the runoff. unsuccessful races in 2010, jones launched an unsuccessful campaign for the u.s. congress in georgia\\'s 4th congressional district. in 2014, jones ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of dekalb county, ga. he lost to incumbent sheriff jeff mann, 76% to 24%. return to the georgia house in march 2016, jones filed to run for georgia house of representatives, this time in house district 91, an open seat vacated by dee dawkins-haigler. in the may 2016 democratic primary election, jones came within sixty votes of an outright victory, but was forced into a runoff election with rhonda taylor. jones won the july runoff election and in november 2016, once again won election to the georgia house, defeating republican carl anuszczyk. endorsement of donald trump and change in party affiliation on april 14, 2020, jones became the first state elected democratic official in georgia to endorse president donald trump\\'s re-election bid. jones said he had no plans to switch political parties and cited trump\\'s \"handling of the economy, his support for historically black colleges and his criminal justice initiatives\" as reasons for his endorsement. jones was swiftly disowned by georgia democrats, many of whom announced support for jones\\' primary challenger, rhonda taylor. after initially saying he would resign from the state house, jones reversed himself and said that he would complete the rest of his term, but would not seek reelection. jones addressed the republican national convention in august 2020 and reiterated his endorsement of trump. on october 16, 2020, jones spoke at a trump rally in macon, georgia and crowd-surfed afterwards, which drew criticism as it occurred in the middle of a pandemic with a mostly maskless crowd. jones promoted and perpetuated trump\\'s false claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. jones withdrew his bid for re-election in 2020 and his term ended on january 11, 2021. on january 6, 2021, he spoke at a rally in washington d.c. before trump\\'s own speech, saying that he stands \"firm for president donald j. trump\" and announcing that he was changing his party affiliation from democrat to republican amid cheers from the audience; after the rally, the pro-trump protesters stormed the united states capitol building. 2022 georgia gubernatorial election in april 2021, jones announced his intention to declare a run in the 2022 georgia gubernatorial election against incumbent republican brian kemp. he was joined by 107th mayor of new york city rudy giuliani and 40th new york city police commissioner bernard kerik in his announcement. his announcement came after movement from republicans to challenge kemp in the challenge, after donald trump criticized kemp for refusing to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in georgia. jones trailed kemp and former senator david perdue in the republican primary polls. in february 2022, jones announced that he was suspending his campaign and endorsed perdue. 2022 united states house campaign after withdrawing his candidacy for governor, jones announced he would run for the united states house of representatives in georgia\\'s 10th congressional district. he entered the crowded republican primary with the endorsement of former president donald trump. jones pledged if elected, he would introduce articles of impeachment against president joe biden and vice president kamala harris. in may 2022, jones placed second in the primary behind trucking executive mike collins. neither candidate got above 50% of the vote so the two advanced to a runoff in june 2022, which jones lost. political positions during his 2008 senate campaign, jones described himself as a \"conservative democrat\" who favors \"tough immigration laws and fiscal responsibility\" as well as \"supporter of gun rights and a staunch environmental advocate\". during his 2008 campaign, he stated that he opposed same-sex marriage. ontheissues.org rated jones as a \"moderate libertarian conservative\". jones stated that he voted for george w. bush in 2004, and supported barack obama in 2008. jones donated $2,464 (~$ in ) in two separate donations to the georgia republican party in 2001. in a 2014 press release, jones characterized himself as an \"advocate for limited government, security and protections for all citizens, balanced budgeting, ethical and efficient elections, [and] job creation\". jones was the only democratic cosponsor of the bill to legalize the concealed carry of firearms on georgia\\'s college campuses. position on abortion jones has been unclear about his position on abortion. while he was a democratic member of the georgia house of representatives, he voted against georgia house bill 481, an anti-abortion law that sought to prevent georgia physicians from performing an abortion beyond six weeks. he claimed at the time that he would become speaker of the georgia house because of the anti-abortion bill if democrats took the house. while running for the republican nomination for the 2022 georgia gubernatorial election, he told the university of georgia\\'s college republicans organization that he voted against hb 481 because the bill did not go far enough to protect unborn children. lgbt civil rights jones opposes civil rights for lgbt people, having told steve bannon, \"civil rights for blacks, and gay rights for gays, are two different things.\" controversies behavior toward women according to a 2021 examination of jones\\' record by the atlanta journal-constitution, \"jones has a long history of problematic behavior toward women, repeatedly accused of threatening, intimidating and harassing women in his personal and professional lives\" over three decades. the newspaper reviewed several previously reported episodes, as well as new details that had not previously been reported. in june 1989, three years before his election to the state legislature, jones (who was then 28 years old) was arrested on a charge of pointing a pistol at a woman in her home in doraville. criminal charges were dismissed, and jones was ordered to attend anger management classes instead. in 2003, a community activist who complained about jones\\' handling of flooding issues said that a disheveled jones, accompanied by a plainclothes county police officer, confronted her in the evening at her home, approaching her with waving arms and clenched fists and mentioning her husband\\'s recent death. the activist said that she felt threatened and intimidated by jones. a prosecutor declined to charge jones with criminal trespass, but warned jones to stay away from the activist. the activist sued jones for trespassing and assault; the case was settled out of court on confidential terms in 2009. in 2004, dekalb county commissioner elaine boyer made a complaint to decatur police that jones \"deliberately walked into her and made hard shoulder-to-shoulder contact\" after a heated public meeting; she did not pursue charges against jones, but accused him of verbally abusing commissioners and staff and making \"derogatory and degrading comments.\" a woman accused jones of raping her in late december 2004 at a party at his home. before detectives could take the statement of the woman, the police chief of dekalb telephoned jones to inform him of the allegation; a georgia attorney general\\'s office investigation concluded that the chief\\'s call was inappropriate. the woman\\'s name was later leaked to the media, and in 2005, the woman declined to press charges, citing the emotional distress that it would entail. jones was not prosecuted, and the allegation did not cause him significant political damage. security detail expenses in 2003, jones was investigated by a grand jury for his security detail, which cost $800,000 a year. the cost of the detail far surpassed other county officials. the grand jury investigation found that jones\\' five-officer protective detail was \"a very expensive decoration\" but not unlawful. jury finding of hostile work environment in 2004, two current (michael bryant, john drake) and two former (becky kelley, herbert lowe) senior employees of the parks department at the time filed suit against jones (as ceo of the county), as well as three of jones\\' subordinates (former parks director marilyn boyd drew, his former executive assistant richard stogner, and morris williams), and dekalb county. the plaintiffs alleged racial discrimination, or in the case of lowe, \"retaliation for refusing to assist in racial discrimination\". kelly, bryant, and drake were white, while lowe was black. the defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity. in 2006, u.s. district judge william s. duffey jr. denied their motion, holding that the law does not allow \"a public official defendant to engage in calculated racial discrimination costumed in a racially neutral garb of administrative actions so it can masquerade as a qualified immunity defense\". on november 21, 2006, duffey ruled that the case could go forward to a jury trial. in 2009, the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit rejected an appeal by jones and other defendants, upholding the denial of summary judgment. judge gerald bard tjoflat, writing for the court, wrote in the ruling that dekalb county had \"embarked on a wholesale plan to replace its white county managers with african americans\" and that jones had \"devised the plan and monitored its execution\". at a jury trial in 2010, the plaintiffs\\' attorneys called witnesses from across county government in an attempt to demonstrate a countywide policy of discrimination. jones denied any discrimination. testimony revealed that during the first five years of jones\\' term in office, the number of white senior county managers had dropped from 61 to 57, and the number of african-american senior county managers had risen from 33 to 61. on april 2, 2010, the jury awarded damages to two of the four plaintiffs (to bryant, who died before the trial, and to john drake). the jury found dekalb county liable for intentional discrimination. the jury found that jones, stogner, and drew \"created and maintained a hostile work environment\"; they were ordered to pay $185,000 in damages, which was lower than the $2 million requested by plaintiffs. jones was ordered to personally pay $27,750 in damages, which was covered by dekalb county\\'s liability insurance policy. while the verdict was initially hailed as a victory for jones, the judge later awarded the plaintiffs an additional $1.9 million in legal fees. in a post-trial settlement, dekalb county ultimately agreed to pay the plaintiffs a total of $1.3 million for legal fees and damages. references external links |- |- 1960 births protesters in or near the january 6 united states capitol attack candidates in the 2022 united states house of representatives elections county executives in georgia (u.s. state) georgia (u.s. state) democrats georgia (u.s. state) republicans living people members of the georgia house of representatives north carolina central university alumni people from lincoln county, north carolina african-american state legislators in georgia (u.s. state) 21st-century american politicians black conservatism in the united states 21st-century african-american politicians 20th-century african-american politicians',\n",

       " 'the creative gene: how books, movies, and music inspired the creator of death stranding and metal gear solid is an autobiographical book written by japanese video game designer hideo kojima, published on october 12, 2021, by viz media. based on the collection of essays titled the gifted gene and my lovable memes which was published in japan in 2019, the book focuses on kojima\\'s inspirations on his work from various pop culture media, such as books, movies and music. exploring themes such as isolationism, loneliness, grief and death, the creative gene collocates personal anecdotes of kojima\\'s life involving his inspirations with his sentiments towards the multitude of works that inspired him. the creative gene received positive reviews from critics, with praise given towards kojima\\'s exploration of his inspirations and their influence on his life. background and development hideo kojima is a japanese video game designer notable for creating the video game series metal gear and the games policenauts, snatcher and death stranding. appraised as an \"auteur\" and a prominent figure in the video game industry, kojima wrote the book the gifted gene and my lovable memes as a collection of essays detailing his inspirations. written in japanese, the book was originally published by shincho bunko and released in japan on october 27, 2019. in february 2021, publisher viz media announced that a translated version of the book would be released on october 12, under the title of the creative gene: how books, movies, and music inspired the creator of death stranding and metal gear solid. premise and content the creative gene is an autobiographical book comprising a variety of short stories, essays and anecdotes encompassing kojima\\'s life, many of which focus on the various pop culture media kojima developed an adoration for and how they have impacted him. one of the first essays in the book recounts kojima\\'s affinity for literature originating from his childhood; proclaiming himself as a \"latchkey kid\", kojima routinely read books as a child as a way to deal with his father\\'s death, gaining life experience from the lessons he learned from books along with movies. kojima further elaborates his beliefs on storytelling, stating that \"stories allow you to experience places you could never go - the past, the future, or distant worlds. you can become a different ethnicity or gender. even when you\\'re reading all by yourself, you\\'re sharing those stories as they unfold before you with countless people whom you\\'ve never met.\" kojima also discusses his routine for visiting bookstores during his free time, conveying that exploring the various works of literature helps him \"become better at finding encounters that are meaningful to me, and i further hone my sensibilities.\" one notable essay in the book deals with kojima\\'s adoration of outer space stemming from his childhood. originally published in 2009, the essay delves into the impact that space has had on kojima\\'s outlook on humanity and reveals his dream to venture into space someday. in the essay, kojima expressed that he would be satisfied with orbiting around earth\\'s atmosphere, along with confessing that he would sacrifice his position as a game designer to pursue his dream. kojima also avowed his desire to become an astronaut, but relinquished his dream to settle on game design due to the limits of japan\\'s developing space program during his childhood. another essay, published in 2011, combines kojima\\'s review of hiro arikawa\\'s 2008 light novel hankyu densha with his childhood recollections of the hankyu railway. the chapter sees kojima recalling memories of riding trains on the railway in various moments of his life, including his adulthood where he rode the train again one year before writing the essay. kojima reflected on the sentimental value of hankyu railway, writing that the railway was \"not just a means of getting from one place to another, but a time machine connecting my memories to my hometown.\" themes and style various publications noted that the book chronicles the connections between kojima\\'s favorite works of media and his sentiments on events surrounding his life. through such interwoven reflections, the creative gene explores how media consumption frames humanity\\'s perception of the world. writing for the a.v. club, sam barsanti considered the media discussed in kojima\\'s essays as tangential subjects that ultimately reflected larger ideas prevalent in his life. barsanti asserted that the essay on the japanese anime series space battleship yamato delved into kojima\\'s relationship with his father. he also noted a similar pattern with the essay on tv shows bewitched, little house on the prairie and anime shin chan exploring how the death of his father influenced his values on family. cameron kunzelman of paste magazine stated that the book shows kojima \"constantly reflecting his own experiences with media through what was happening in both his personal life and the broader context of japanese culture\". discussing him as a creator whose developed aesthetic tastes aided in his ability to direct games, he elaborates that kojima\\'s inspirations in his work demonstrate the \"philosophy of creation, in which the individual person is always a kind of cultural nexus who mixes influences and produces new things\". publications also noted that kojima eschews overt explanations of his specific creative process and mere summaries of his inspirations in the creative gene. joshua furr of dualshockers wrote that the book contained few references to the video games he created such as the metal gear saga, instead discussing books, films and music that related to his life. kunzelman claimed that the creative gene addresses topics such as loneliness, death and grief. he wrote that the book contains a \"tragic focus\" prevailing through many of the stories, arguing that kojima\\'s propensity to focus on darker works of media \"center on his interest in the relationship between people, their societies, and how they deal with massive environmental changes\". annette polis of siliconera notes that the book divulges aspects of kojima\\'s personal life such as coping with his father\\'s death and his conflicts with depression, while furr noted an essay about the film taxi driver (1976) as relating to his experiences with childhood seclusion, with him identifying with character travis bickle. publications also commented on an essay dedicated to satoshi itoh about the novelization of metal gear solid 4: guns of the patriots (2008) as reflecting themes of death in the book; itoh, a close friend of kojima and the novelization\\'s author, succumbed to cancer in 2009 at the age of 34, shortly after the novel\\'s completion. rich stanton of pc gamer related the book\\'s themes of loneliness, regret and isolationism to death stranding, also connecting the game with kojima\\'s essay on taxi driver. aspects of the book elaborate on themes explored in kojima\\'s games, such as genes, memes and scenes; all three ideas were explored in the metal gear solid games. barsanti noted that the creative gene extensively focuses on the idea of memes, with kojima\\'s discussions on the media he enjoys conveying how information influences the upbringing of individuals. kunzelman referred to kojima\\'s emphasis on memes as \"dawkinsian\", describing kojima\\'s views on memes as coming from a more individualized standpoint involving the spread of ideas amongst people. writing for gameshub, indie game developer naphtali faulkner analyzed kojima\\'s relationships with media in the context of creation, namely how ideas that develop beyond various generations inspire works of art. faulkner states that through the exploration of media, the book \"shows how we can start to think about memes as more than just homage - how we can start to cut away the surface of the things we like, and dig down into the spirit of the ideas that resonate with us\". reception the creative gene received positive reviews from media outlets, several of whom praised the personal and heartfelt nature of the book. the a.v. clubs barsanti rated the book an a-, praising kojima\\'s passionate expressions for his favorite works of art; he opined that the best moments of the book \"are glimpses into the mind of a visionary artist who just happens to work in a medium that isn\\'t always known for its capacity for visionary art\". kunzelman commended the book and felt it not only offered insight into kojima\\'s influences, but also the recurring dark motifs found in his life and oeuvre. comparing the book to kojima\\'s affinity for science fiction tragedies, kunzelman regarded the book as akin to a premonition that offers \"a glimpse into a particular kind of human machine\", also asserting that \"embracing it wholly would put us down the wrong path\". stanton similarly offered praise and minor criticism for the book as well, believing that the book alternates between profundity which would invoke immersion in readers, and moments of self-indulgence that would enable skim reading. engadgets jeff dunn ranked the creative gene among his favorite books of 2022, praising the book for both its honesty and its esteem towards art and the creative process. several critics noted that the creative gene gave them and readers a more profound appreciation for works of fiction as well. polis found that aspects of her life related to the multitude of media that kojima enjoyed, observing that they shared a common interest in authors such as agatha christie, miyuki miyabe and kazuo umezz. she also stated that through such similar interests she resonated more with kojima, propounding that the book was a \"fantastic look into the mind of one of gaming\\'s best known designers\". furr expressed that the book demonstrated a strong endearment for media that he had not found elsewhere. remarking that readers would recognize how particular works of media inspired ideas in kojima\\'s games, kunzelman viewed the book as an edifying way to grasp one\\'s influences. barsanti averred that while readers may not necessarily share the same adoration for kojima\\'s favorite works of art as him, the book might give readers an ardent admiration for the works of art they personally enjoy. see also the selfish gene references further reading external links the creative gene at viz media\\'s official website hideo kojima 2021 non-fiction books 2021 short story collections japanese books japanese short story collections japanese autobiographies japanese non-fiction literature japanese non-fiction books',\n",

       " 'in philosophy of science, idealization is the process by which scientific models assume facts about the phenomenon being modeled that are strictly false but make models easier to understand or solve. that is, it is determined whether the phenomenon approximates an \"ideal case,\" then the model is applied to make a prediction based on that ideal case. if an approximation is accurate, the model will have high predictive power; for example, it is not usually necessary to account for air resistance when determining the acceleration of a falling bowling ball, and doing so would be more complicated. in this case, air resistance is idealized to be zero. although this is not strictly true, it is a good approximation because its effect is negligible compared to that of gravity. idealizations may allow predictions to be made when none otherwise could be. for example, the approximation of air resistance as zero was the only option before the formulation of stokes\\' law allowed the calculation of drag forces. many debates surrounding the usefulness of a particular model are about the appropriateness of different idealizations. early use galileo used the concept of idealization in order to formulate the law of free fall. galileo, in his study of bodies in motion, set up experiments that assumed frictionless surfaces and spheres of perfect roundness. the crudity of ordinary objects has the potential to obscure their mathematical essence, and idealization is used to combat this tendency. the most well-known example of idealization in galileo\\'s experiments is in his analysis of motion. galileo predicted that if a perfectly round and smooth ball were rolled along a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, there would be nothing to stop the ball (in fact, it would slide instead of roll, because rolling requires friction). this hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that there is no air resistance. other examples mathematics geometry involves the process of idealization because it studies ideal entities, forms and figures. perfect circles, spheres, straight lines and angles are abstractions that help us think about and investigate the world. science an example of the use of idealization in physics is in boyle\\'s gas law: given any x and any y, if all the molecules in y are perfectly elastic and spherical, possess equal masses and volumes, have negligible size, and exert no forces on one another except during collisions, then if x is a gas and y is a given mass of x which is trapped in a vessel of variable size and the temperature of y is kept constant, then any decrease of the volume of y increases the pressure of y proportionally, and vice versa. in physics, people will often solve for newtonian systems without friction. while we know that friction is present in actual systems, solving the model without friction can provide insights to the behavior of actual systems where the force of friction is negligible. social science it has been argued by the \"poznań school\" (in poland) that karl marx used idealization in the social sciences (see the works written by leszek nowak). similarly, in economic models individuals are assumed to make maximally rational choices. this assumption, although known to be violated by actual humans, can often lead to insights about the behavior of human populations. in psychology, idealization refers to a defence mechanism in which a person perceives another to be better (or have more desirable attributes) than would actually be supported by the evidence. this sometimes occurs in child custody conflicts. the child of a single parent frequently may imagine (\"idealize\") the (ideal) absent parent to have those characteristics of a perfect parent. however, the child may find imagination is favorable to reality. upon meeting that parent, the child may be happy for a while, but disappointed later when learning that the parent does not actually nurture, support and protect as the former caretaker parent had. a notable proponent of idealization in both the natural sciences and the social sciences was the economist milton friedman. in his view, the standard by which we should assess an empirical theory is the accuracy of the predictions that that theory makes. this amounts to an instrumentalist conception of science, including social science. he also argues against the criticism that we should reject an empirical theory if we find that the assumptions of that theory are not realistic, in the sense of being imperfect descriptions of reality. this criticism is wrongheaded, friedman claims, because the assumptions of any empirical theory are necessarily unrealistic, since such a theory must abstract from the particular details of each instance of the phenomenon that the theory seeks to explain. this leads him to the conclusion that \"[t]ruly important and significant hypotheses will be found to have ‘assumptions\\' that are wildly inaccurate descriptive representations of reality, and, in general, the more significant the theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions (in this sense).\" consistently with this, he makes the case for seeing the assumptions of neoclassical positive economics as not importantly different from the idealizations that are employed in natural science, drawing a comparison between treating a falling body as if it were falling in a vacuum and viewing firms as if they were rational actors seeking to maximize expected returns. against this instrumentalist conception, which judges empirical theories on the basis of their predictive success, the social theorist jon elster has argued that an explanation in the social sciences is more convincing when it ‘opens the black box\\' — that is to say, when the explanation specifies a chain of events leading from the independent variable to the dependent variable. the more detailed this chain, argues elster, the less likely it is that the explanation specifying that chain is neglecting a hidden variable that could account for both the independent variable and the dependent variable. relatedly, he also contends that social-scientific explanations should be formulated in terms of causal mechanisms, which he defines as \"frequently occurring and easily recognizable causal patterns that are triggered under generally unknown conditions or with indeterminate consequences.\" all this informs elster\\'s disagreement with rational-choice theory in general and friedman in particular. on elster\\'s analysis, friedman is right to argue that criticizing the assumptions of an empirical theory as unrealistic is misguided, but he is mistaken to defend on this basis the value of rational-choice theory in social science (especially economics). elster presents two reasons for why this is the case: first, because rational-choice theory does not illuminate \"a mechanism that brings about non-intentionally the same outcome that a superrational agent could have calculated intentionally\", a mechanism \"that would simulate rationality\"; and second, because rational-choice explanations do not provide precise, pinpoint predictions, comparable to those of quantum mechanics. when a theory can predict outcomes that precisely, then, elster contends, we have reason to believe that theory is true. accordingly, elster wonders whether the as-if assumptions of rational-choice theory help explain any social or political phenomenon. science education in science education, idealized science can be thought of as engaging students in the practices of science and doing so authentically, which means allowing for the messiness of scientific work without needing to be immersed in the complexity of professional science and its esoteric content. this helps the student develop the mindset of a scientist as well as their habits and dispositions. idealized science is especially important for learning science because of the deeply cognitively and materially distributed nature of modern science, where most science is done by larger groups of scientists. one example is a 2016 gravitational waves paper listing over a thousand authors and more than a hundred science institutions. by simplifying the content, students can engage in all aspects of scientific work and not just add one small piece of the whole project. idealized science also helps to dispel the notion that science simply follows a single set scientific method. instead, idealized science provides a framework for the iterative nature of scientific work, the reliance on critique, and the social aspects that help continually guide the work. limits on use while idealization is used extensively by certain scientific disciplines, it has been rejected by others. for instance, edmund husserl recognized the importance of idealization but opposed its application to the study of the mind, holding that mental phenomena do not lend themselves to idealization. although idealization is considered one of the essential elements of modern science, it is nonetheless the source of continued controversy in the literature of the philosophy of science. for example, nancy cartwright suggested that galilean idealization presupposes tendencies or capacities in nature and that this allows for generalization beyond what is the ideal case. there is continued philosophical concern over how galileo\\'s idealization method assists in the description of the behavior of individuals or objects in the real world. since the laws created through idealization (such as the ideal gas law) describe only the behavior of ideal bodies, these laws can only be used to predict the behavior of real bodies when a considerable number of factors have been physically eliminated (e.g. through shielding conditions) or ignored. laws that account for these factors are usually more complicated and in some cases have not yet been developed. see also spherical cow references further

       " \"alice h. eagly (born 1938) is the james padilla chair of arts and sciences emerita and emerita professor of psychology at northwestern university. she is also a fellow at the institute of policy research at northwestern university. her primary research focus is social psychology, as well as personality psychology and industrial organizational psychology. she was elected as a member of the national academy of sciences in 2022. early life and education eagly was born in 1938, in los angeles, to harold and josara hendrickson. she completed her undergraduate degree at harvard university in social relations in 1960. she received her m.a. in psychology and her ph.d. in social psychology from the university of michigan. she also holds two honorary doctorates: from the university of bern (bern, switzerland) and from erasmus university (rotterdam, netherlands). in 1962, she married robert eagly, who she had met while studying in norway. although the two had not planned to reverse social roles, this became their lifestyle after eagly succeeded further in her career and they concluded that robert would become the stay-at-home parent. this lifestyle change exemplifies the social role studies that eagly was very much involved in. career eagly has held teaching positions at several universities including northwestern university, michigan state university, university of massachusetts, and purdue university, as well as visiting positions at university of illinois, harvard university, university of tübingen, university of amsterdam, and university of southern california. she has written or contributed to 7 books and over 100 journal articles. research social role theory eagly developed the social role theory which attributes current sex differences to the labor division between men and women. while conducting research pertaining to the social role theory, eagly was a member of an observation team that explored stereotype content. to begin this research, they collected data on the development of stereotypes through observations and preliminary research of participants' beliefs. these beliefs were then compared to various members of social groups. within this theory, eagly compares gender differences and stereotypes, which have the potential to lead to prejudice. prejudices are formed when individuals hold stereotypes about a social group that does not agree with the attributes that are typically perceived as being required for success in certain social roles. eagly uses much of her research to show that discrimination happens when the individual steps outside of the given stereotype ascribed to their group. this is a basis for much of her research on gender discrimination and stereotypes. according to eagly, an attitude is made of evaluation, attitude object, and tendency. evaluation encompasses all aspects of reacting inwardly or outwardly and to react based upon a believed feeling or emotion. an attitude object is any thing that can cause a reaction in an individual. tendency is formed through past experiences. each individual has their own attitude based on these three components that resonate with other's attitudes in order to form similar patterns of thought and stereotypes. one of her most important contributions to the field of psychology is her theory on role congruity, the belief that prejudice arises when one social groups' stereotype mismatches their valued success in other social roles, specifically among men and women. that is, society views one social groups role to be exclusive to that group in particular, and that venturing outside this could not be a successful endeavor, thus creating prejudicial attitudes. eagly explores this idea in her research to show that the attributes ascribed to the group are not necessarily negative, but just different from that which is assumed of the group. a stereotype that eagly spent time studying was physical beauty and levels of attractiveness. this stereotype is composed of physical attractiveness, media content, and social attention given to those with certain outward characteristics. due to the fact that society as a whole has been seen through studies as more accepting of physically attractive individuals, the stereotype has formed that they also hold characteristics and attributes that are positive and favorable. eagly has contributed several notable studies to the body of research on sex differences. for example, her work in the area of mate-preferences showed that men and women who held more traditional gender ideologies preferred more gender stereotypical qualities in a partner. women with more traditional attitudes looked for older mates while more traditional men sought younger mates compared to males and females who reported less traditional gender ideologies. in an additional study, eagly found that participant's mate-preferences could be shifted by asking them to see themselves in different marital roles. when instructed to envision oneself in the provider role, participants placed a greater emphasis on a mate's homemaker skills and the preferred age for the mate decreased. she also found, however, that changing one's expected marital role could not eliminate gender differences in preference for earning potential; women consistently looked for a greater earning potential in a mate compared to men. other research that eagly participated in looks at women who were highly educated and their anticipated marital roles. this study shows that these women anticipated inequality in areas such as employment hours, salary, housework and childcare in comparison to the amount of work that they expected their husbands to do. further research in this study also shows that women who anticipated greater employment opportunity showed a general decrease in gender role assumptions, but also felt that they felt their relationships with their family and emotional well-being would be affected adversely. this theory emphasizes the social component of sex differences. it operates around the idea of correspondence inference, which is the tendency to ascribe a person's behavior to her or his disposition or personality and to underestimate the extent to which situational factors elicited the behavior. eagly suggests that men and women were constrained to certain roles in the work force and then assumed to embody the psychological characteristics of those roles without exception. women and men can be classified by differing prosocial behaviors. these behaviors are categorized as communion or agency. communal traits are identified as concerned with others, friendly, unselfish and emotionally expressive; these communal traits are more commonly associated with females. agentic traits are identified as dominant, competitive, and assertive, and are associated more commonly with males. feminism according to eagly's studies, she refers to the differences found in gender stated as male or female due to the standard xx or xy chromosomes present. when working with the feminist theory, eagly introduces the biosocial theory that considers the division of labor as a core principle. she also believes that when considering feminism and science there are not specifically congruent ideas that point to sameness when considering the biological differences between men and women. eagly stands for accuracy and interpreting scientific data in order to be used when making these comparisons. when it comes to leadership while considering feminism, neither men nor women have an inherited advantage when it comes to style or effectiveness. there are many traits that are associated with being a good leader that may be classified as feminine characteristics such as kindness and concern for others. while these traits may describe the feminine attitude with more depth, they may also be a shortcoming. eagly states that women must have these caring traits while also be willing to show confidence and assertion, which many find to be incompatible. selected works eagly, a. h., & chaiken, s.

       " 'zespół filmowy „x\" is a polish film production studio, inaugurated on new year\\'s day, 1972. the studio\\'s formation was the brainchild of acclaimed polish director andrzej wajda, who served as the artistic director for the duration of the studio\\'s existence. history at this time in poland, the custom of the communist government\\'s cultural authorities was to separate film production in to teams that functioned also as film schools for the novices in their employ. in the beginning, this was usually done regionally. it was also something of a reward system for the country\\'s most highly regarded film directors, who were offered appointments as artistic director of the various teams. in late 1970 or early 1971, the polish cultural authorities approached andrzej wajda, at that time enjoying a particularly fecund episode in his career coming off a string of international successes, with the possibility of directing one of these teams. after some hesitation, wajda cautiously accepted this promotion. directing these teams was a tripartite affair and wajda quickly surrounded himself with energetic young talents, appointing barbara pec-ślesicka head of production and constantine puzyna as the team\\'s literary director. in 1973, puzyna stepped down and was replaced by bolesław michałek. wajda, pec-ślesicka, and michałek remained in these positions until may 1983, when in a period of martial law the team was forcibly shut down by the polish government in retaliation for the political positions adopted by the team as manifested in the team\\'s film product and in wajda\\'s, in particular, identification with the solidarity (polish trade union) movement. zespół filmowy x\\'s first production was the second film of enfant terrible andrzej żuławski, diabeł (the devil). this film - a lavish and diabolically surrealistic depiction of the effects of the aftermath of the kościuszko uprising and the third partition of poland on a once noble-family in a bleak, wintry polish countryside - was met immediately with stern condemnation from the polish cultural authorities. the film existed under a state of suppression until 1987, when the film was finally released after the hardline of the government softened due to increasing pressure from within to open the society. this picture set the tone for the bulk of zespół filmowy x\\'s output: challenging pictures with high artistic standards. the fallout from diabeł\\'s suppression earned greater scrutiny for the team from the authorities, żuławski\\'s departure for france and a climate of relaxed control, and exclusion of the team from cinemas, which had the effect of relegating for a time all the team\\'s production to television. throughout the studio\\'s existence these standards were maintained and the team produced several acclaimed pictures from several notable directors. the studio reached the pinnacle of cinematic achievement when wajda\\'s film man of iron collected the palme d\\'or and the prize of the ecumenical jury at the 1981 cannes film festival. of zespół filmowy x\\'s atmosphere of openness, director ryszard bugajski recalled that: our team, as indeed this was true of all the teams, divisions, affiliates, unions, and delegations in poland, was a simple bureaucratic institution of stamps, files, punches, official soap, and a bunch of kids attending night school. but it was also one of the few public places where, with a mug of hot tea brewed in a communal effort, almost like in hyde park\\'s speakers corner in london, one could without brakes applied express different opinions - mostly unflattering of authority - surrounded by piles of unapproved scenarios, warmth and family. all in accordance with applicable rules of discipline, this was a place where one could work and celebrate the birthdays of friendly people and other anti-state occasions.\" - quoted in wanda werenstein\\'s zespół filmowy \"x\" filmography (selected) the devil (1972), directed by andrzej żuławski. the wedding (1972), directed by andrzej wajda. the promised land (1974), directed by andrzej wajda. w środku lata (in the middle of summer) (1975), directed by feliks falk. obrazki z życia (pictures of life) (1976), an anthology film. smuga cienia (the shadow line) (1976), directed by andrzej wajda. motylem jestem czyli romans 40-latka (1976), directed by jerzy gruza. zdjęcia próbne (test screenings) (1976), directed by agnieszka holland, paweł kędzierski and jerzy domaradzki. man of marble (1977), directed by andrzej wajda. prawo archimedesa (the archimedes principle) (1977), directed by mariusz walter. indeks. życie i twórczość józefa m.

       " \"hans speckaert ( - ) was a flemish renaissance painter who was active in italy. he is known for his portraits, history paintings and his many drawings. the artist was one of the earliest representatives of northern mannerism. his fluid and elegant drawing style exerted an important influence on contemporary northern artists. life details about the life of the artist are scarce. according to the early flemish painter and artist biographer karel van mander speckaert was the son of an embroiderer in brussels and a friend of the painter aert mijtens. he may have received his training in the brussels workshop of pieter de kempeneer who was known as pedro campaña (1503-1580). he travelled to italy at an unknown date and is believed to have arrived in rome sometime in 1566. van mander visited italy during the period that speckaert was there. in rome, speckaert joined a group of northern painters working in rome in the 16th century. he made a close study of the art of the great italian renaissance masters michelangelo, raphael, and others. a document from april 1575 reports that the artist had been paralyzed. possibly this was the result of an accident which had occurred while he was working at an unknown church early in the year 1575, together with the artist anthonie van santvoort. there was a dispute with the painter's guild over hans speckaert having worked in a church in rome with his friend anthonie van santvoort without its authorization. after a long period in rome, speckaert attempted to return to the netherlands and got as far as florence, but feeling unwell, he turned back to rome, where he died. his death likely occurred around 1577. work hans speckaert is known for his portraits, history paintings and his many drawings. only four paintings have been attributed with certainty to the artist, including the portrait of the engraver cornelis cort (kunsthistorisches museum), who was a close friend. the other known paintings include moses and the brazen serpent (museo nacional de bellas artes, buenos aires), diana and actaeon (palazzo patrizi, rome) and the conversion of st paul (louvre, paris). he made designs for prints that were executed by cornelis cort en aegidius sadeler and form the basis for further attributions. his oeuvre is not yet clearly defined, since the attribution of drawings is hampered by the fact that the artist's work was widely imitated. his close study of the art of the italian renaissance masters informs the muscular, monumental figures in his work. in his jaël and sisera (museum boijmans van beuningen) the short perspective of the deceased sisera shows the mannerist preoccupation with the depiction of the human body. the emphatic, somewhat theatrical, postures of jael and her companion barak are characteristic of his mannerism. the work of jacopo bertoja, which was close to that of parmigianino, was influential on his style. speckaert's fluid and elegant drawing style exerted an important influence on his northern contemporaries, as is witnessed, in particular, in the drawings of bartholomeus spranger, jan soens, hans von aachen, joseph heintz the elder and karel van mander. this was made possible because speckaert's friend anthonie van santvoort, who managed his estate after his death and inherited his drawings via cornelis cort, who died a year after speckaert, opened his house to artists who visited rome so that they could study speckaert's drawings. speckaert's designs were used as models for prints by aegidius sadeler, cornelis cort, pedro perret and jan harmensz. muller. references external links 1540s births 1570s deaths flemish renaissance painters artists from brussels\",\n",

       " 'the vulcan street plant was the first edison hydroelectric central station. the plant was built on the fox river in appleton, wisconsin, and put into operation on september 30, 1882. according to the american society of mechanical engineers, the vulcan street plant is considered to be \"the first hydro-electric central station to serve a system of private and commercial customers in north america\". it is a national historic mechanical engineering landmark, an ieee milestone and a national historic civil engineering landmark. the vulcan street plant was housed in the appleton paper and pulp company building, which burned to the ground in 1891. a replica of the vulcan street plant was later built on south oneida street. origin the vulcan street plant was conceptualized by h. j. rogers - who was the president of the appleton paper and pulp co. and of the appleton gas light co. during this time. according to the institute of electrical and electronics engineering, h. j. rogers first came up with the idea for a hydro-electric central station after talking with a friend of his, h. e. jacobs, while they were on a fishing trip. the appleton edison electric light company h. e. jacobs, who was working for western edison light company of chicago as a licensing agent, informed h. j. rogers about thomas edison\\'s plan for a steam-driven electric power plant in new york city called the pearl street plant. upon learning about edison\\'s advances in electric light technology and electric generators, rogers worked to bring together a group of investors to create one of the first hydro-electric central stations in the world. for this reason, the appleton edison electric light company was formed and incorporated on may 25, 1882. while edison\\'s pearl street plant was still under construction, the founders of the appleton edison electric light company - h. e. jacobs, a. l. smith, h. d. smith, and charles beveridge - began planning the vulcan street plant. in july 1882, engineer p. d. johnston, who worked for western edison light company of chicago during this time, visited appleton to explain the details of edison\\'s lighting system to the founders of the appleton edison electric light company. after this meeting, the founders decided to test the viability of hydro-electric lighting by first installing it in their homes and mills. as a result, two edison \"k\" type generators were ordered. the first generator was installed in h. j. roger\\'s paper mill, the appleton paper and pulp company, and is the generator that began operation on september 30, 1882. the second generator was installed in its building on vulcan street and began operation on november 25, 1882. problems and successes on september 27, 1882, the first generator began operation, but without success. hence, edward t. ames, the installer, returned to appleton to correct the problem. after a few days of troubleshooting, the generator was repaired and successfully entered operation on september 30, 1882. this was only 26 days after thomas edison began to successfully operate his steam-driven pearl street plant in new york, which began operation on september 4, 1882. the output of the original generator was about 12.5 kilowatts. the first buildings to be lit by the vulcan street plant were h.j. rogers\\' home, the appleton paper and pulp company building, and the vulcan paper mill, which were all connected directly to the generator. initially, the buildings\\' direct connection to the generator caused many problems because the generator was directly connected to the waterwheel. the water from the fox river did not flow at a constant rate, so the lights did not maintain constant brightness and often burned out. this problem was resolved by moving the generator to a lean-to off the main building, where it was attached to a separate water wheel that allowed for a more even load distribution. during the time of the vulcan street plant, voltage regulators did not exist. operators had to look at the light itself to determine if it was at the proper brightness, and they adjusted the voltage according to their observations. electricity meters did not exist at that time, so customers were charged a flat monthly fee based on the number of electric lamps installed in their building. hence, many people left their lights on all night. the original electric distribution lines in appleton were made of bare copper. this posed many challenges in the early development of commercial electricity, because nearly everything was made of wood or other flammable materials. the wiring used in buildings was insulated by a thin layer of cotton and was fastened to walls using wood cleats. likewise, wood was used for fuse boxes, light sockets, and switch handles. appleton\\'s first electrically lit buildings h. j. rogers\\' home, which has been converted to be the hearthstone historic house museum, is one of the few surviving examples of wiring and lighting fixtures from the dawn of the electrical age. the vulcan street plant and the appleton paper and pulp company building burned to the ground in 1891, and the vulcan paper mill was dismantled in 1908. after the vulcan street plant was destroyed by fire, an exact replica was built on south oneida street and was opened to the public on september 30, 1932. according to the minutes taken at the appleton historic preservation committee meeting on october 21, 2008, the replica of the vulcan street plant was, \"... painstakingly constructed duplicating all of the building\\'s original features.\" this site was dedicated as an asme national historic engineering landmark, jointly designated with asce and ieee on september 15, 1977. see also war of the currents samuel insull references energy infrastructure completed in 1882 buildings and structures in appleton, wisconsin hydroelectric power plants in wisconsin historic civil engineering landmarks',\n",

both subsp\\'s are similarly dispersed across western new south wales. victoria - subsp. stipitata occurs in the far north-west and near bacchus marsh. subsp. miscella is limited to the far north-west. seeds from the a. stipitata can be distributed worldwide. a. stipitata has been introduced to the california coastline in the united states of america to aid in the rehabilitation of saline soils. habitat a. stipitata prefers saline soils of clay loam and coarse textured soils. it is often sighted in areas with solonized brown soils which are high in calcium and magnesium carbonate, and thrives in eroded red soils when there is limited competition from other species. a.stipitata subsp stipitata is more frequently observed in mixed chenopod shrublands and has a stronger affinity to saline soils whereas subsp miscella is more commonly observed in open woodlands. a. stipitata survives well in dry degraded soils and has been reportedly sighted in creek banks, stony flats, slopes and ridges, flat plains and outwash plains. uses traditional a. stipitata, also known as bitter saltbush, is one of the lesser consumed saltbush due to its bitter flavour. however, saltbush was used for traditional medicinal purposes. the leaves of saltbush plants were ground down and mixed with water to form a saline solution used to clean and disinfect mild skin conditions and wounds. agricultural a. stipitata performs well on agricultural land, as it is not the most palatable of the saltbush species. this species only becomes favourable to sheep and livestock when other forage is scarce. a. stipitata is high in potassium, nitrogen and protein with high digestibility making it suitable for agriculture grazing, however the high sodium content in the plant make it only desirable when there is water readily available. agriculture farmers have observed a link to saltbush grazing and an increase in milk production and more successful birth rates in sheep. this is attested not only to the nutrient value of the plant, but also to the increased water intake of the sheep when grazing. references external links atriplex stipitata occurrence data from australasian virtual herbarium flickr images: atriplex stipitata atriplex stipitata k000898568, collected in 1860 by the victorian exploring expedition at duroodoo stipitata flora of australia plants described in 1870 taxa named by george bentham flora of victoria (state) flora of new south wales flora of south australia flora of the northern territory dioecious plants',\n",

       " 'monkeys are one of the smartest animals amongst the animal kingdom according to the chinese culture. monkeys, particularly macaques and monkey-like gibbons, have played significant roles in chinese culture for over two thousand years. some examples familiar to english speakers include the zodiacal year of the monkey, the monkey king sun wukong in the novel journey to the west, familiar from its tv version monkey, and monkey kung fu. terminology the chinese language has numerous words meaning \"simian; monkey; ape\", some of which have diachronically changed meanings in reference to different simians. for instance, chinese xingxing 猩猩 was originally named \"a mythical creature with a human face and pig body\", and became the modern name for the \"orangutan\". within the classification of chinese characters, almost all \"monkey; ape\" words - with the exceptions of nao 夒 and yu 禺 that were originally monkey pictographs - are written with radical-phonetic compound characters. these characters combine a radical or classifier that roughly indicates semantic field, usually the \"dog/quadruped radical\" 犭 for simians, and a phonetic element that suggests pronunciation. for instance, this animal classifier is a graphic component in hou 猴 (with a hou 侯 \"marquis\" phonetic) \"macaque; monkey\" and yuan 猿 (with yuan 袁 \"long robe\") \"gibbon; monkey\". note that the following discussion of \"monkey; ape\" terminology will cite three fundamental sources. the oldest extant chinese dictionary, the (c. 3rd century bce) erya (chapter 18, 釋獸 \"explaining wild animals\") glosses seven names for monkeys and monkey-like creatures in the 寓屬 \"monkey/wild animal\" taxonomy. the first chinese character dictionary, the (121 ce) shuowen jiezi defines many names of simians, primarily under the (犬部 \"dog/quadruped\" radical) in chapter 11. the classic chinese pharmacopoeia, li shizhen\\'s (1597) bencao gangmu (獸之四 \"animals no. 4\" chapter) lists medical uses for five yu 寓 \"monkeys\" and three kuai 怪 \"supernatural beings\". the latter are wangliang 魍魎 \"a demon that eats the livers of corpses\", penghou 彭侯 \"a tree spirit that resembles a black tailless dog\", and feng 封 \"an edible monster that resembles a two-eyed lump of flesh\". li shizhen distinguishes 11 varieties of monkeys: a small one with a short tail is called hou ([猴] monkey). if it looks like a monkey but has a prominent moustache, then it is called ju [狙]. if it looks like a monkey but is bigger, then it is jue [貜]. a monkey that is big, with red eyes and a long tail, is called yu [禺]. a monkey that is small but has a long tail and an upright nose is called you [狖]. a monkey that is similar to you but is bigger is called guoran [果然]. a monkey that is similar to you but smaller is called mengsong [蒙頌]. a monkey that is similar to you but jumps a lot is called canhu [獑猢]. a monkey that has long arms is called yuan ([猿] ape). a monkey that is similar to yuan but has a golden tail is called rong [狨]. a monkey that is similar to yuan but bigger, and can eat apes and monkeys, is called du [獨]. (s.v. jue) nao nao 夒 was the first \"monkey\" term recorded in the historical corpus of written chinese, and frequently appeared in (14th-11th centuries bce) shang dynasty oracle bone inscriptions. this oracle pictograph of \"a monkey\" showed its head, arms, legs, and short tail; which were convergented as 目/頁 (\"head\"/\"eye\"), 又/爪 (\"hand\"/\"claw\") and later 止 (\"foot\", which was a corruption from 爪 in this character), 已/巳 (\"finished\"/\"foetus\", which was corrupt from the tail) not later than the end of (6th century bce) spring and autumn period bronze script. compare the seal character for kui 夔 \"a legendary demon with a human face and body of a monkey/dragon\", which resembles the seal character for nao with the addition of what appears to be long hair on its head. this graphically complex character nao 夒 \"monkey\" had an early variant nao 獿 (with the \"quadruped\" radical and nao phonetic), and a simpler replacement nao 猱 \"monkey\" (same radical and a rou 柔 phonetic), which is common in modern usage. the etymology of nao lushai ŋau \"grey monkey\"; compare nû 夒 above. the shuowen jiezi defines yu 禺 as \"a kind of muhou \"monkey\" with a head resembling a gui \"ghost\"\" (母猴屬頭似鬼). compare the above definition of nao as a muhou \"monkey\" resembling a person. yu 禺 has a graphic variant yu 寓 (with the \"roof radical\") \"reside; imply\". the erya (18) lists monkey definitions under a yushu 寓屬 \"wild animal category\". guo pu\\'s commentary explains yu 寓 inclusively means all shou 獸 \"wild animals\", and van gulik says it means \"primates in general\". the shanhaijing uses yu 禺 to describe the xingxing, \"there is an animal on the mountain which looks like a long-tailed ape, but it has white ears. it crouches as it moves along and it runs like a human. its name is the live-lively. if you eat it, you\\'ll be a good runner\". the shanhaijing records a mythical yugu 禺谷 \"monkey valley\", the place where the sun sets, which suggests that \"the monkey is a kind of guardian of the approaches to the nether world\". kuafu 禺谷 \"boast father raced with the sun and ran with the setting sun\", but died of thirst on the way. yugu is also written as yu 虞 \"predict; deceive\" or ou 偶 \"human image; mate\". hou and muhou hou 猴 \"monkey; macaque\" is a common name for simians. for instance, houzi 猴子 means \"monkey\" or \"clever/glib person\". muhou 母猴 \"macaque; rhesus monkey\" compounds mu \"mother\" and hou \"monkey\", and can also mean \"female monkey\" in modern usage. van gulik says that muhou is a phonetic rendering of a non-chinese term\" because mu- occurs in four variants: 母 and 沐 \"wash one\\'s hair\" in zhou texts, and 米 \"rice\" or 獼 in han texts. in modern chinese usage, mihou 獼猴 means \"macaque; rhesus monkey\". the etymology of hou burmese myok and mru yuk \"monkey\". you < ju phonologically resembles two old chinese \"monkey\" words: yu < ŋoh 禺 and hou < gô 猴. the character猶, with the \"quadruped radical\" and a qiu 酋 phonetic, originally denoted a simian, but became a common chinese phonetic loan character for you \"still; yet\". the erya glosses you as \"like a muntjac and good at climbing trees\" (如麂善登木). hao yixing 郝懿行\\'s 19th-century sub-commentary says, \"the wild animal you is a kind of monkey, shaped like a muntjac, which resembles a hornless deer with feet like a dog.\" the you is also called youhu 猶猢 and identified as the husun 猢猻. the shuowen jiezi defines you as \"a kind of jue \"large monkey\", you is also said to be the longxi [modern tianshui region] word for \"puppy\" (玃屬一曰隴西謂犬子為猷). du du 獨 (lit. \"alone\") named \"a larger monkey\", which was interpreted as a monkey with \"solitary habits\", based on the word\\'s literal meaning. read identifies it as \"a species of baboon or mandrill\". the bencao gangmu rong 狨 entry notes the du 獨. du looks like an ape but is bigger. it stays alone and gives a single cry at a time. it eats apes and monkeys. so there is an idiom saying that when a du cries, all apes will disperse. the term \"dufu\" (獨夫, a lone man, or a \"dictator.\") has its origin in this animal. some say this animal is actually the huangyao [黄腰 \"yellow waist\"]. also see explanations in the class of hu (tiger). the bencao gangmu entry for hu 虎 \"tiger\" lists huangyao among animals that are strong enough to kill and eat tigers. guoran guoran 果然 (lit. \"indeed; really\") or 猓然 is described as \"a timid monkey with a long tail\". van gulik tentatively associates guoran with the surili monkeys of the genus presbytis found in southeast asia. the bencao gangmu entry for the guoran 果然, which read identifies as the \"proboscis monkey, nasalis larvatus\", lists synonyms of yu 禺, you 狖, lei or wei 蜼, and xianhou 仙猴 \"transcendent monkey\". guo pu: guoran is an animal that cries in a way as if it is calling its own name. luo yuan (羅願): if one of them is caught, a whole group of them will cry and attack. even when some are being killed, others will stay by. so it is called guoran. the term means \"assured,\" meaning when one is endangered, it can be assured that the others will come to its rescue. a big one is called ran, or yu. a small one is called you or lei. people in the south call it xianhou [仙猴]. chen cangqi [陳藏器]: the book nanzhou yiwu zhi: in the area of jiaozhou there is a kind of animal called guoran. it is bigger than an ape. its body is no more than three chi long, but its tail may rise above its head when erect. its nostrils open upward. at times of rain, it will hang itself on a tree with its tail stuffed into its nostrils. its hair is long, soft, fine and slippery. it is white with black stripes, resembling the colored feathers of a gray duck. its hide and fur can be made into very warm fur coats and quilts. the book er ya recorded an animal with \"upward nostrils and long tail,\" which is really this animal. li shizhen: guoran is an animal that is kind. they are found in the mountains in the south-west. they live in trees. guoran looks like an ape. it has a white face with black cheeks. it has a big moustache and multicolored hair. its tail is long and forked at the tip. when it rains, guoran stuffs the forked tips of its tail into its nostrils. they like to travel together, the aged ones in the front and the young ones at the back. when they find food, each gives the chance to others to eat first. they live together harmoniously and love each other dearly. when one is endangered, all the others will come to its rescue. as liu zongyuan [柳子] noted, it is an animal that is benevolent, polite, filial and kindhearted. in ancient times, the animal was painted as an image of politeness, filial piety and wisdom. however, it is an animal that is very suspicious. when they see a man coming they will climb up a tree and change positions many times. sometimes they will run wildly, breaking their heads or legs. that is why people say that if a person is so suspicious, he can be compared to this animal. this guoran heading has two subheadings. mengsong 蒙頌 or menggui 蒙貴 (see below). chanhu 獑猢, which the shuowen writes with the \"rat radical\" 鼠 as zhanhu shu 斬𪕮鼠, is described by li shizhen it is a kind of guoran. it is black with a white stripe on the waist like a belt. its hands are covered with long white hair. they are held in a manner as if clutching a piece of board. the book shudi zhi [蜀地志]: the canhu looks like a monkey. it moves very fast and stays in the trees all the time, jumping from one tree to another like a bird. mengsong mengsong 蒙頌 or menggui 蒙貴 (lit. \"cover praise\" or \"cover expensive\") \"a dark monkey, a skillful rat-catcher\" is an obscure ancient name. read suggests mengsong was the \"mongoose, herpestidae mungo\". the erya succinctly defines mengsong as \"shaped like a [nao] monkey\" (蒙頌猱狀). since the erya dictionary, which glosses words from the chinese classics, has the oldest textual usage of mengsong, the name presumably comes from a lost pre-qin classic. guo pu\\'s commentary gives the synonym menggui and says, \"an animal like a small [wei] proboscis monkey, purple black in color, from yunnan (交趾 \"annam\"). they are reared as rat catchers better than cats.\" guo says these monkeys came from present-day central vietnam, specifically jiuzhen 九真 and rinan 日南, modern khánh hòa province and nghệ an province. the tang author duan chengshi\\'s (853) miscellaneous morsels from youyang says, \"cats are also named menggui or wuyuan 烏員 [lit. \"crow member\"].\" the bencao gangmu subsumes mengsong under the guoran \"monkey\" entry: \"mengsong is also called menggui. it is small guoran. purple and black, it is found in jiaozhi. it is raised in houses. it catches mice even better than a cat or a leopard.\" taxonomy the simians (higher primates) of china include two families of old world monkeys (cercopithecidae) and lesser apes or gibbons (hylobatidae, lit. \"wood walkers\"), listed with modern chinese nomenclature: family: cercopithecidae (舊大陸猴科) genus: macaca (獼猴屬) stump-tailed macaque macaca arctoides (短尾猴) assam macaque macaca assamensis (熊猴,阿薩姆猴) rhesus macaque macaca mulatta

hylobates (長臂猿屬) lar gibbon hylobates lar (白掌長臂猿) genus: nomascus (黑冠長臂猿屬) black crested gibbon nomascus concolor (白頰長臂猿) white-cheeked crested gibbon nomascus leucogenys (白胸長臂猿) eastern black crested gibbon nomascus nasutus (東方黑冠長臂猿) zodiac the monkey is the ninth of the twelve-year animal cycle in the \"chinese zodiac\". the year of the monkey is associated with ninth earthly branch symbol shen 申 denoting the southwest direction and seventh lunar month. for example, one year of the monkey begins february 8, 2016. mythology several mythical or semi-mythical monkeys are mentioned above in the terminology section. early texts treat the juefu 貜父 (cf. japanese kakuen) as both a factual \"large ape found in western mountains\" and a mythological \"single-sex species that abducts and mates with humans\"; said to be either all males (viz. fu 父 \"father\") who rape women (soushenji) or all females who rape men (bencao gangmu, cf. xingxing). the early pictographs for nao 夒 \"monkey\" and kui 夔 \"a legendary demon with a human face and body of a monkey/dragon\" were nearly identical. chinese legends say that foreign textiles used xingxing 猩猩 blood as a scarlet dye. many chinese mythological creatures are said to resemble monkeys or apes. for instance, the xiao 囂 is described as \"a long-armed ape\" and the shanxiao 山魈 \"mountain imp\" supposedly had a human face and a monkey\\'s body. the lake-dwelling shuihouzi 水猴子 \"water monkey\" is said to like drowning people. based on the data for the juefu, xingxing, and feifei, van gulik concluded that, [e]ach of these three \"monstrosities of the mountains\" is a composite figure: a combination of two entirely different creatures, as observed by those ancient chinese - hunters, travelers and soldiers - who ventured into the virgin mountain forests of the south-west. in the first place, glimpses caught of some larger simioid. in the case of the [feifei], the \"human\" face, long lips, and long red hair could apply to the orangutan. i leave it to zoologists to decide whether it is at all possible that two thousand years ago the habitat of the orangutan could have reached as far north as indo-china. second, chinese impressions gathered during encounters with the aborigines. in this direction point the \"nearly human speech\", the pelting with stones, and the killing and/or abducting of man and women. ever since during the han dynasty the southwest was brought into the orbit of chinese administration, these mountain tribes have succeeded in retaining their identity - even though chinese rule was oppressive, and punitive expeditions against them launched as late as the end of the nineteenth century. relations between the tribes and the chinese were always uneasy, and chinese tales about the aborigines often mention their killing and abducting chinese citizens. the theory that [juefu], [xingxing], and [feifei] are the combined result of such observations is also supported by the fact that in the oldest pictures preserved, the human features prevail over the simian. like the indian monkey-god hanuman in hindu mythology, chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys. the best-known of these is sun wukong, the main protagonist in wu cheng\\'en\\'s picaresque novel journey to the west, also known as monkey. in the southern regions of china, many temples were built to the monkey-god who is worshipped as the qitian dasheng 齊天大聖 \"great saint equal to heaven\", which was a name of sun wukong. wolfram eberhard explains, \"it is not only in indian mythology that the monkey plays a leading part; it is also found in south chinese and in tibetan legend. several varieties of monkey are native to south china; and according to one tibetan myth, the tibetan people are descended from a monkey\", namely pha trelgen changchup sempa. \"tales of women who have been abducted and ravished by monkeys and who have then given birth to children, are common in south china, and several chinese \\'clans\\' attribute their origins to such a union.\" eberhard calls yang 楊 the \"monkey clan\", citing the totemistic myth recorded in the soushenji and fayuan zhulin that the yangs living in southwestern shu (state) (modern sichuan) were descendants of monkeys. the soushenji (12) \"reported that in the southwest of shu there were monkey-like animals whose names were [jiaguo 猳國], [mahua 馬化], or [jueyuan 玃猿, see \"jue and juefu\"]. these animals abducted women and sent them back when they became pregnant. if the baby were not accepted, the woman would have to die. therefore these children were raised and they received the clan name yang. for this reason this clan occurred quite frequently in southwest shu.\" according to orally transmitted accounts collected from the miao ethnic group of china, at first there were no people, but rather the ancestors of modern humans were monkeys. one day the monkeys went to play in a cave, where a divine dragon resided. the dragon blew upon the monkeys its divine breath, which caused them to be transformed into modern human beings. religious significance chinese religions use monkeys and apes as metaphors for people. in chinese folk religion, some shape-shifting monkeys were said to be human ancestors. in daoism, monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed have longevity like a xian \"transcendent; immortal\". in chinese buddhism, on the one hand, monkeys symbolized restless and foolish humans, and on the other hand, gautama buddha was supposedly a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation. folk religion chinese traditional folk religion regards monkeys as supernatural beings. eberhard cites early reports that monkeys \"could talk\", \"knew the past\", and \"were like men\". jan jakob maria de groot\\'s classic study of chinese religions distinguishes \"monkey demons\" and \"were-monkeys\", both of which could shape shift between a monkey and a human. while a monkey demon \"often acts as a dangerous devil\" (frequently transforming in order to have sex with a human), a were-monkey was usually virtuous (e.g., the monkey who takes human shape in order to become a buddhist monk, xuanshizhi 宣室志). \"monkey demons\" could assume both male and female forms. de groot describes them as either \"a lewd fornicator of wives and maids\" or \"a seductress, in beautiful female forms, of adults and inexperienced youths, whose senses it bewitches at the detriment of their health\". for instance, the (4th century) in search of the supernatural records a monkey-demon story from the era of emperor xiaowu of jin. in the [taiyuan] period (376-396) of the [jin] dynasty they kept a monkey in the back palace of [dizhao 昭翟], prince of [dingling], in front of the chambers of his concubines. these women once upon a time simultaneously got in the family way, and each of them gave birth to three children that danced and hopped while discharging from the bowels. [zhao] thus being convinced that the monkey was the culprit, killed the beast and the children; which made the women burst out all at once into wailing. he interrogated them, and they avowed they had seen a young man dressed with a yellow silk robe and a white gauze cap, a most lovely personage, jesting and chatting quite like a man. legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common, as noted above jue ape-men copulate with women and zhou monkey-women copulate with men. the youyang zazu tells a legend that the chinese peoples were descendants of simians: \"a monkey married the female servant of a daughter of heaven and thus became ancestor of the [ji]; another monkey also married the servant of a daughter of heaven and became founder of the [cheng]\" - using ji 姬 (lit. \"imperial concubine\") as \"a general term for southern peoples\" and cheng 傖 (or cang 傖 \"coarse; vulgar\") as \"an insulting word for north chinese who had migrated to the south\". the baopuzi lists ways to protect oneself from mountain demons associated with different astronomical days (chap. 17), including \"on a day shen [申 \"monkey\"], a man calling himself a lord is a monkey [猴]; a [day jiuqing 九卿], an ape [猿].\" \"were-monkeys\" (named in analogy with werewolf) were frequently older monkeys that transformed into humans. the (c. 1st century) wu yue chunqiu tells a story about king goujian of yue (r. 496-465 bce) wanting to improve his army\\'s military skill. one of his ministers suggested: i have recently heard about a virgin girl in [yue] who has come from the southern forest. the people of that country praise her (martial skill). i request you to summon her, and grant her an interview at once.\" the king of [yue] sent envoys to summon her to be questioned about the art of fighting with sword and halberd. when the virgin set out for the north for an audience with the king; she met on her way an old man. he said his name was mr. [yuan] and addressed her \"i have heard that you are skilled in swordsmanship, i wish you would show me!\" the girl replied \"your handmaid would not dare to conceal anything from you. you just test me!\" thereupon mr. [yuan] swept his walking staff over a cluster of bamboo trees, and (in that one sweep) laid all the twigs and branches bare. before the falling leaves had reached the ground, however, the girl had caught them all (on her sword), mr. [yuan] then flew up into a tree, and changed into a white gibbon. mr. yuan is named yuan gong 袁公, a wordplay upon yuan 猿 \"gibbon; monkey\". noting that this \"monkey-man\" called himself a member of the yuan 袁 (\"monkey\") clan, de groot says, \"in subsequent ages it continues a feature of monkey-myth to represent were-monkeys as persons bearing that tribal name, just as man-foxes were … often believed to be members of the hu tribe.\"—referring to the pun between hu 狐 \"fox\" and the hu 胡 (\"barbarian\") clan. baiyuan 白猨 \"white gibbons\" like \"mr. yuan\" were considered to be spiritually powerful. the (c. 239 bce) lüshi chunqiu has a \"knack story\" about the legendary archer yang youji 養由基 and a shen baiyuan \"supernatural white gibbon\" that instinctively knew the intentions of humans. yang youji and yin ru were both men of highly refined skills. in the courtyard of the palace of chu there was a magical white ape, which even the best archers could not hit, and so the king of chu asked yang youji to try. yang youji picked up his bow and arrows and went to try. before shooting, he had already pinned it with his arrows; with a single shot, the ape fell. thus, yang youji had the ability to hit his target before actually hitting his target. (chap. 24) the (121 bce) huainanzi tells a simpler version of this story. the king of chu had a white ape. when the king himself shot at it, the ape grabbed his arrows to show off. he ordered yang youji to shoot it. when [yang] began to draw the bow and aim the arrow, [even] before he shot, the ape hugged a tree and shrieked. this is hitting the target before hitting the target. (16) daoism daoism, like buddhism, paradoxically treats monkeys as both foolish and wise animals. the (c. 4th-3rd centuries bce) daoist zhuangzi illustrates the gibbon/macaque distinction (see symbolism section). the first story is about a jugong 狙公 \"macaque/monkey trainer\". to weary the spiritual intelligence by trying to unify things without knowing that they are already identical is called \"three in the morning.\" why is this called \"three in the morning\"? once upon a time, there was a monkey keeper who was feeding little chestnuts to his charges. \"i\\'ll give you three in the morning and four in the evening,\" he told them. all the monkeys were angry. \"all right, then,\" said the keeper, \"i\\'ll give you four in the morning and three in the evening.\" all the monkeys were happy with this arrangement. without adversely affecting either the name or the reality of the amount that he fed them, the keeper acted in accordance with the feelings of the monkeys. he too recognized the mutual dependence of \"this\" and \"that.\" consequently, the sage harmonizes the right and wrong of things and rests at the center of the celestial potter\\'s wheel. this is called \"dual procession.\" (chap. 2) zhuangzi tells a yuan 猿 \"gibbon\" parable to the king of wei. master chuang passed by the king of wei wearing patched clothing made of coarse cloth and shoes tied together with twine. \"how come you\\'re so wretched, master?\" asked the king of wei. \"it\\'s poverty,\" said master chuang, \"not wretchedness. when a scholar possesses the way and integrity but cannot put them into practice, he is wretched. when his clothing is tattered and his shoes have holes in them, he is poor, not wretched. this is called, \\'not having met with the right time\\': has your majesty not seen the high-climbing gibbon? when it is on a nanmu, catalpa, or camphor tree [all tall, straight trees], the gibbon grasps the branches with its hands and feet or wraps around them with its tail, moving nimbly among them. even yi and p\\'engmeng [the famous mythical archers houyi and his disciple] would not be able to take accurate aim at it. when, however, the gibbon is on a silkworm thorn, ramosissimus, thorny limebush, or matrimony vine [all short, thorny bushes], it moves furtively and glances sideways, shaking and trembling all the while. this is not because the gibbon\\'s sinews and bones have become stiff and lost their suppleness, but because it finds itself in an inconvenient situation and cannot show off its ability. now, if i am situated under a benighted ruler and confused ministers, and still wish not to be wretched, how could i be so?\" (20) the daoist discipline of daoyin \"guide and pull\" is based on the notion that circulating and absorbing qi \"breath; life force\" in the body can lead to longevity or even immortality. long-limbed animals were believed to be innately adept at absorbing qi and thus acquire \"occult powers, including the ability to assume human shape, and to prolong their life to several hundred years\". for example, the (c. 4th century) chunqiu fanlu says, \"the gibbon resembles the macaque, but he is larger, and his colour is black. his forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing.\" the baopuzi lists animals associated with longevity, including (chap. 3), \"a macaque may evolve into an ape after 800 years. after another 500 years it evolves into jue, and jue will evolve into chanchu (toad) after 1,000 years.\" another animal associated with longevity was the he 鶴 \"crane\", whose long neck and legs supposedly enabled the bird to absorb qi and live up to a thousand years. the pair of yuanhe 猿鶴 \"gibbon and crane\", both of which were famous for their graceful movements, became a literary and artistic trope for a \"long life\". the (624) yiwen leiju encyclopedia quotes a baopuzi story, not found in the received text, about king mu of zhou (r. 976-922 bce). \"when king mu of the [zhou] dynasty made his expedition to the south, his entire (routed) army was transformed. the \"gentlemen\" [君子] among his troops changed into gibbons or cranes, the \"small men\" [小人] into insects or grains of sand.\", noting that this widely quoted passage \"sets up the gibbon as the gentleman among the primates - a position he has kept till the present day.\" buddhism when buddhism was first transmitted into china circa the 2nd century ce, monkeys were already an ancient tradition in buddhist texts. sutras frequently quote the buddha to use \"monkey\" similes. the dhammapada (334) says: \"the craving of a person given to heedless living grows like a creeper. like the monkey seeking fruits in the forest, he leaps from life to life (tasting the fruits of his kamma).\" the samyutta nikaya (12.61) says: \"just as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of one branch, lets that go and grabs another, then lets that go and grabs still another, so too that which is called \\'mind\\' and \\'mentality\\' and \\'consciousness\\' arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night.\" several of the jataka tales describe the buddha\\'s past lives as a monkey or an ape (see the four harmonious animals). for example, the mahakapi jataka or great monkey king. in the heart of a himavat there was a large tree, which bore excellent fruits even bigger than the palmyra nuts having exceedingly sweet flavor; lovely hue and fragrance, which no man had ever seen or noticed before. this tree was also the abode of several monkeys; and the bodhisatta was born as the king of those monkeys. he was much larger in size than his followers; and was more compassionate and virtuous than others. one day, the monkey king noticed that a branch of the tree had grown just over the stream. it alarmed him, because some of the fruits might drop in the stream, which then might get carried away to the man\\'s world; and the men would then certainly come to have all the fruits for themselves. so, he instructed the monkeys not to let any fruit grow on that branch if they wished to enjoy the fruits for a longer period. … [however, one piece of fruit fell and floated downstream, where it came into the hands of a king who] tasted it, and then remarked, \"nothing could surpass the flavor of this fruit\". he then ordered his men to hunt for the tree in and around the river-bank which bore the fruit. soon the king\\'s men found out the tree laden with such luscious and delicious fruits. when they saw the monkeys enjoying those fruits, which their king wanted to have so eagerly, they attacked the monkeys mercilessly with volleys of arrows. witnessing the approaching attacking royal soldiers the bodhisatta jumped on a mountain peak, which the other monkeys were not likely to copy. there, in order to save his friends he seized a strong rooted tall cane with his legs and bending it towards the tree jumped back and caught hold of the branch of the tree. he then called upon the other monkeys to use him as a bridge to jump upon the mountain peak. taking advantage of the situation all the monkeys jumped on the mountain and darted away quickly. the monkey king was, however, terribly bruised and injured by being trampled by his mates when acting as a bridge for them. soon he swooned. the king watched the flight of the monkeys; and also the plight of the monkey king. he was greatly moved by the exemplification of such insight; courage; valor; and sacrifice, which an animal had just displayed to save the lives of his subjects. the king then ordered his men to delicately bring down the unconscious ape and gently place him on a couch and to render the best possible first aid. when the great monkey regained his consciousness the king asked him to explain as to why did he endangered his life to save his subjects, who were rather meant to serve or sacrifice. like a guru, he then said, \"o king! verily my body is broken but my mind is still sound; i uplifted only those over whom i exercised my royal powers for so long.\" and before the king could utter some words of praise for the great monkey; he found him dead. chinese buddhists adapted and expanded upon these traditional \"monkey\" metaphors for human qualities. a famous chan buddhist example is the chinese xinyuan \"mind monkey\", which is a buddhist psychological metaphor describing \"unsettled; restless; inconstant\" mentality. the word xinyuan 心猿 \"heart-/mind-monkey\" is frequently combined with yima 意馬 \"thought-/will-horse\" in the four character idiom xinyuan yima or yima xinyuan, reflecting the previously mentioned association between monkeys and horses (and a major motif in the journey to the west). literature monkeys are a traditional theme in chinese literature. besides the prominent \"monkey king\" sun wukong mentioned above, gibbons and macaques are popular images in chinese poetry. van gulik says nearly every chinese poet who wrote from the 3rd to 7th centuries referred to the \"graceful movements of the gibbon and his saddening calls\". for instance, the tang poet li bai wrote poems about gibbons 白猿 in the qiupu 秋浦 region (in south-central modern anhui province). in [qiupu] there are many white gibbons, swirling through the trees as so many snow flakes. pulling their young with them along the thin branches, drinking they play with the reflected moon in the water. a modern example is robert van gulik\\'s judge dee story \"the morning of the monkey\", published in the monkey and the tiger. symbolism reflecting the simial likenesses among humans, monkeys, and apes, many languages symbolically use \"monkey; ape\" words in reference to people. english monkey, for instance, can mean a \"mischievous child\", \"person with minimal intelligence and/or bad looks\", or \"menial employee who does a repetitive job\"; and ape can mean \"uncivilized person\", \"wild; crazy\", or \"imitate; mimic\". compare the chinese words houzi 猴子 \"monkey; mischievous/glib person\", hour 猴儿 \"monkey; endearing term for a child\", and houjing 猴精 \"monkey spirit; clever and roguish person\". zhou dynasty culture symbolically contrasted the gibbon as \"gentleman; sage\" (junzi 君子 or sheng 聖) and the macaque as \"commoner; petty person\" (xiaoren 小人). a sharp distinction was drawn … between the superior gibbon and the inferior macaque. the macaque, frequently coming down to inhabited areas to forage, and therefore often seen and easily caught, became a familiar sight in daily life. trained macaques formed part of the performances of travelling showmen, amusing young and old alike by their clever tricks. the gibbon, on the contrary, inhabiting as it did the upper canopy of the primeval forest, rarely seen and extremely difficult to catch, was regarded as a denizen of the inscrutable, forbidding world of the high mountains and deep valleys, peopled by fairies and goblins. accordingly, the macaque was the symbol of human astute trickery but also of human credulity and general foolishness; and the gibbon the symbol of the world of the supernatural, mysterious and remote from man\\'s daily life. see the zhuangzi stories (under \"daoism\"). eberhard describes a traditional chinese literary motif that monkeys will sometimes seduce and impregnate women, who give birth to either a monkey-child or a monkey spirit. thus, in the \"popular mind\", says eberhard, a monkey can also symbolize an adulterer. art the earliest chinese monkey-shaped objects, believed to have been belt hooks, date from the late eastern zhou period (4th-3rd centuries bce) and depict a gibbon with outstretched arms and hook-shaped hands. the oldest extant painting of a monkey is attributed to the buddhist monk and artist guanxiu (832-912). it shows a gibbon offering peaches to a luohan 羅漢 \"arhat\", which says \"firmly establishes this painting in a buddhistic context\". gibbons became a popular subject for chinese painters (for example, yi yuanji, fl. 1050-1075) during the northern song dynasty, and then again from the southern song dynasty into the yuan dynasty, especially for the chan buddhist monk muqi fachang (1210?-1269?). monkeys are a frequent motif in modern chinese art. several examples are based on a visual pun between hou 侯 \"marquis; count\" and hou 猴 \"monkey\". since mashang 馬上 literally means \"on horseback\" or figuratively \"immediately\", an image of a monkey riding a horse is called mashang fenghou馬上封侯 \"may you immediately be conferred the rank of marquis\", which is a chinese gift of congratulations for gaining promotion. another visual pun showing one monkey crouching on the bei 背 \"back\" of another bei 辈 \"generation\" can be interpreted as \"may you rank as marquis from generation to generation\"; and a painting of two monkeys in a tree has the same signification. another frequent image is a monkey holding a peach, as in the 16th-century novel fengshen yanyi, which refers to a legend that a monkey stole the peaches of immortality from the garden of xi wangmu \"queen mother of the west\". the familiar three wise monkeys are a japanese, rather than chinese, pictorial maxim to \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\". see monkeys in japanese culture for more information. pharmacology simians have played a role in traditional chinese medicine, \"which maintains that the meat, bones and livers of monkeys have various curative effects, ranging from detoxification to improving sex drive\". chinese state-owned medicine companies buy about 2 tons of monkey bones annually, estimated as \"taken from at least 1,500 primates.\" the (1597) bencao gangmu lists pharmacological uses for four monkeys. the mihou \"monkey; macaque\" is the most versatile. rou 肉 \"meat\": \"pickled in wine it is good for chronic malaria, and all kinds of lassitude. it is prophylactic against malaria. in the south it is considered a delicacy smoked or salted.\" tougu 頭骨 \"skull\": \"ashed and given with wine for malaria. boiled in water it is used as a bath for children in convulsions, and for feverish chills.\" shou 手 \"paw\": \"for children in convulsions.\" shi 屎 \"feces\": \"applied to spider bites. ashed and given with honey to children in convulsions, and for colic.\" pi 皮 \"skin\": \"to treat infectious diseases in horses. a female monkey kept in the stable of a horse is most effective. the menstrual fluid [houjing 猴經] shed on to the straw is eaten by the horse and the latter gets a lasting immunity against infectious disease.\" the meat and blood of a rong 狨 \"gibbon\" are used for anal fistula, and the fat for scabies. read notes \"the placenta, liver, and bile of the gibbon are used in japanese domestic medicine.\" the meat of a guoran 果然 monkey is prescribed for malaria and chills. the meat of a xingxing 猩猩 monkey supposedly \"cures drowsiness and hunger, and desire for a cereal diet, it allows an exhausted man to travel well, and old age will not tell on him\". this refers to the daoist bigu \"avoiding grains\" fasting technique associated with achieving xian \"transcendence; immortality\". cuisine monkey meat, as mentioned above in the bencao gangmu, was traditionally considered both a medicine and a delicacy in chinese cuisine. several chinese classics record the practice. the lüshi chunqiu lists roast \"lips of the xingxing ape\" among the five finest meats. the yiwuzhi records a \"special soup made of monkey head was typical for southern peoples.\" the huainanzi (19) has a story about eating monkeys: \"a man from chu had some boiled monkey meat that he gave to his neighbors. they thought it was dog meat and found its flavor pleasing. later, when they heard it was monkey, they knelt down and vomited all they had eaten. this was a case of not even beginning to know about flavor.\" eating monkey brains, hounao 猴腦, is a controversial practice. qing emperors ate monkey brains during feasts known as the manchu han imperial banquet. according to stephen chen, the son of chef joyce chen, qing emperors \"were partial to scooping out the brain of a living monkey for a tasty treat, and the practice continues to this day, particularly in some southern provinces\". modern day official chinese policy with regards to the procurement of certain monkeys for food makes their consumption illegal, with sentences of up to 10 years in prison for violators. martial arts monkey kung fu, or houquan 猴拳 \"monkey fist\", refers to several chinese martial arts techniques utilizing monkey-like movements. modern chinese movies have popularized the drunken monkey style. the monkey is a secondary animal style, besides the basic five animals, or wuxing 五形 \"five forms\", of tiger, crane, leopard, snake, and dragon. the huainanzi (7) criticized yogic practices like the yuanjue 蝯躩 \"gibbon leap\": \"if you huff and puff, exhale and inhale, blow out the old and pull in the new, practice the bear hang, the bird stretch, the duck splash, the ape leap, the owl gaze, and the tiger stare: this is what is practiced by those who nurture the body. they are not the practices of those who polish the mind [e.g., the perfected].\" pets the history of pet monkeys in china goes back at least to the spring and autumn period (771-476 bce). the scholar robert van gulik, who was a great fancier of gibbons, wrote, \"there is only one objection to keeping a gibbon as pet, namely that one is liable to become too fond of it, and cannot bear to part after one\\'s pet has reached maturity.\" the huainanzi (2) mentions caging a gibbon, \"if you put an ape in a cage, it will be just like a pig. it is not that it is no longer clever or agile but that it has nowhere to give free rein to its ability.\" the text (16) also mentions a beloved pet gibbon, \"the king of chu lost his [pet] ape, and [to recapture it] he destroyed every tree in the forest.\" this was likely king gong of chu (r. 590-560 bce) who is identified with a related story (16.89), concerning \"the king of chu had a white ape\" that could catch arrows shot by archers. other traditional chinese holidays include the monkey king festival celebrated on the 16th day of the 8th lunar month, and the birthday of the monkey god, celebrated in singapore on the 16th day of the 1st lunar month. nanwan monkey island is a nature reserve in hainan, china. \"monkey\" is also a popular name for foodstuffs including chinese teas: baimao hou 白毛猴 \"white-haired monkey\" is a type of green tea originating from the wuyi mountains in fujian province houkui tea 猴魁 \"monkey chief\" is a type of green tea originating from taiping county in anhui province golden monkey tea or jinhou cha 金猴茶 is a type of black tea originating from the fujian and yunnan provinces see also \"autumn day in kui prefecture\", a poem by du fu mentioning macaque monkeys hanging in chains. monkeys in japanese culture simians (chinese poetry) vanara, monkey-like humanoids in the ramayana references (german version 1983). footnotes external links the gibbons in china, thomas geissmann, gibbon research lab monkey in japan - india & china lore, mark schumacher gallery = chinese culture monkeys in popular culture primates in popular culture',\n",

       " 'g-funk, short for gangsta funk, (or funk rap) is a sub-genre of gangsta rap that emerged from the west coast scene in the early 1990s. the genre was heavily influenced by the synthesizer-heavy 1970s funk sound of parliament-funkadelic (aka p-funk), often using samples or recreating the original tracks. it was represented by commercially successful albums such as dr. dre\\'s the chronic (1992) and snoop dogg\\'s doggystyle (1993). characteristics g-funk (which uses funk with an artificially altered tempo) incorporates multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, heavy use of the snare drum, background female vocals, the extensive sampling of p-funk tunes, and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. it is typically set at a tempo of anywhere between 80 and 100 bpm. the lyrical content depended on the artist and could consist of sex, drug use (especially marijuana), love for a city/neighborhood, love for friends and relaxing words. there was also a slurred \"lazy\" or \"smooth\" way of rapping in order to clarify words and stay in rhythmic cadence. the trademark west coast g-funk style of hip-hop was a very defining element of the region\\'s music and helped distinguish it from the rivaling rap scene on the east coast. in essence, the smooth, slow-tempo sound of g-funk accompanied the perceived \"laid-back\" stereotype of californian culture whereas east coast hip-hop typically featured more aggressive attitudes alongside a fast-paced tempo (e.g. hardcore hip hop). unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as epmd and the bomb squad), g-funk often utilized fewer, unaltered samples per song. music theorist adam krims has described g-funk as \"a style of generally west coast rap whose musical tracks tend to deploy live instrumentation, heavy on bass and keyboards, with minimal (sometimes no) sampling and often highly conventional harmonic progressions and harmonies\". dr. dre, a pioneer of the g-funk genre, normally uses live musicians to replay the original music of sampled records. this enabled him to produce music that had his own sounds, rather than a direct copy of the sample. history and origins 1989-1992: beginnings early examples of the genre began to show up in 1989 with the d.o.c.\\'s \"it\\'s funky enough\" and \"the formula\", the former was an early minor hit for the genre, reaching no. 12 on the hot r&b/hip-hop songs chart. two years later, in 1991, n.w.a. released another early example of the genre with their album niggaz4life, which reached no. 1 on the billboard 200, and no. 2 on billboards top r&b/hip-hop albums. the same year, ice cube\\'s diss track towards n.w.a., \"no vaseline\", was made in the style. dr. dre, who produced no one can do it better and niggaz4life, is often seen as the originator/creator of the g-funk sound. though these claims have been disputed with , a member of above the law, claiming that he came up with the name and sound. 1992-1997: mainstream peak 1992 was the breakout year for the genre, with dr. dre dropping his album the chronic. the album was a massive success, having three top 40 singles: \"nuthin\\' but a \\'g\\' thang\", the eazy-e diss \"dre day\", and \"let me ride.\" it also reached no. 3 on the billboard 200, and no. 1 on the top r&b/hip-hop albums chart. the album was eventually certified triple platinum by the riaa in 1993 for selling three-million copies, it has also been selected by the library of congress for preservation in the national recording registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". though g-funk had previously existed, dr. dre\\'s the chronic is often seen as the beginning of the genre. the following year had numerous successful songs and albums, ice cube\\'s songs \"it was a good day\" and \"check yo self\" both made it to the top 20, peaking at no. 15 and no. 20 respectively, and were both certified at least gold. \"it was a good day\" is commonly placed high on best of lists for the genre, being considered \"one of the best g-funk tracks ever made\". snoop dogg released his first album doggystyle, which debuted at no. 1 on the billboard 200, and contained the hits \"gin and juice\" and \"what\\'s my name?\", both songs reached no. 8 on the hot 100. the album was certified quadruple platinum, and both singles were certified gold. eazy-e released the g-funk-influenced album it\\'s on (dr. dre) 187um killa, which reached no. 5 on the billboard 200, and contained the no. 42 hit \"real muthaphuckkin g\\'s\", which was made as a response to dre\\'s song \"dre day\" from the previous year. the genre\\'s popularity grew even bigger in 1994, especially because of warren g\\'s song \"regulate\", which was featured on the above the rim soundtrack. the single reached the top 10 peaking at no. 2. his album regulate... g funk era which also contained the song, and another top 10 hit \"this d.j.\", reached no. 2 on the billboard 200. popular rapper mc hammer went for a more gangsta image and g-funk sound on his album the funky headhunter, which contained the no. 26 single \"pumps and a bump\". the g-funk group thug life, featuring 2pac released their first and only album, thug life: volume 1, it peaked at no. 42 on the billboard 200, it had one minor hit single with \"cradle to the grave\", it charted on the hot r&b/hip-hop songs and on the hot rap songs charts, at no. 91 on the former and no. 25 on the latter. westcoast rapper coolio released his debut album it takes a thief in 1994. the album peaked at no. 8, it contains the top-10 hit \"fantastic voyage\". in 1995, 2pac released the album me against the world which although not entirely g-funk, has been described as having \"half the record [resound] to the boom and bap of new york\" while having \"the rest [shimmer] in a g-funk haze\". the album reached no. 1 on the billboard 200, and was certified double platinum. later in the year, he released the g-funk classic \"california love\" which as a double a-side with \"how do u want it\", hit no. 1 on the hot 100. in october 1995, tha dogg pound released their debut album dogg food and it debuted at number 1 on the billboard, continuing g-funk\\'s dominance in the mainstream with the top 50 singles \"new york, new york\" and \"let\\'s

respectively. the album itself peaked at no. 2 on the billboard 200, and was certified platinum by the riaa in 1997. 2pac released his album all eyez on me, which has been described as \"lush g-funk\" and as having a \"commercial g-funk sheen\". the album hit no. 1. in 1997 warren g released his second album, take a look over your shoulder, which peaked at no. 11 on the billboard 200; it had two top-40 singles, a cover of \"i shot the sheriff\" and \"smokin\\' me out\". although the majority of g-funk music has come out of california, the overall sound has been utilized by additional us rappers and hip-hop groups that were based in other states across the u.s. during the time of the style\\'s popularity in the 1990s. some of the most notable of these artists include outkast (georgia), g-slimm (louisiana), bone thugs-n-harmony (ohio), tela (tennessee), top authority (michigan), e.s.g. (texas) and dmg (minnesota). in the 1990s, houston, texas had a small, but noteworthy g-funk scene at the peak of the genre\\'s popularity with artists such as the geto boys, blac monks, e.s.g., 5th ward boyz, street military, big mello, scarface, ganksta n-i-p, bushwick bill, big 50, 5th ward juvenilez and south circle. 1997-present: influences on modern hip hop in the late 1990s and 2000s, g-funk music significantly declined in mainstream popularity. dr. dre\\'s 1999 album 2001, produced by mel-man, was noted as \"reinvent[ing] his sound, moving away from g-funk to something more gothic and string-heavy.\" in 2001 warren g released his fourth studio album, the return of the regulator. the album can be considered a return to the roots of g-funk west coast gangsta music, but it sold less than the rapper\\'s two previous albums. midwestern rapper tech n9ne made use of the g-funk style on his early releases, most notably his second studio album, the worst (2000). his 2001 follow-up album, anghellic, incorporated the subgenre\\'s characteristics to a much lesser extent. most recently, into the 2010s and onward, many contemporary west coast rappers have released albums which contain strong g-funk influences, including kendrick lamar with good kid, m.a.a.d city as well as to pimp a butterfly, yg with still brazy, schoolboy q with blank face lp, nipsey hussle with victory lap, buddy with harlan & alondra and tech n9ne with the gates mixed plate. g-funk also has had somewhat of an impact on the development of modern christian hip hop/gospel rap. for example, many of the albums by the christian recording artists gospel gangstaz, who have also enjoyed relatively mainstream success in the past, have exhibited token g-funk musical elements. see also gangsta rap golden age hip hop list of g-funk artists and producers ice t ice cube references 1990s in music american hip hop genres funk genres music of los angeles music of the san francisco bay area west coast hip hop 1990s neologisms',\n",

       " \"is a japanese superhero film featuring a crossover within the kamen rider series, as well as the super sentai series. scheduled for release on march 29, 2014, characters from all of the kamen rider series, as far back as 1971's kamen rider up through the currently airing series kamen rider gaim appeared, with many of the original actors reprising their roles, including kamen riders hiroshi fujioka. the film serves as a 15th anniversary commemoration of the heisei period run of the kamen rider series, and of gaim being the 30th main kamen rider overall. the film features a battle between the kamen riders from the shōwa period of japanese history with the kamen riders from the heisei period, orchestrated by the evil kamen rider fifteen of the badan empire who has the powers of the 15 heisei kamen riders at his disposal. some warriors of the super sentai series also enter the fray in the film's climax scene. in the lead up to the film, toei allowed fans to vote on who would win in the film's climactic battle: the shōwa riders or the heisei riders. on opening day, it was revealed that the heisei riders won the vote by a narrow margin. the shōwa rider ending initially won the poll but it got an extension that allowed the heisei ending to take the lead at the end. the ending with the shōwa riders winning was also featured on the home video release. on opening weekend, the weekly broadcasts of toqger and gaim were replaced by a one-hour special titled , serving as a prequel to the events of the film that explains the toqgers' connection, the cause of the war, and the involvement of ambassador darkness and the badan empire. plot the film opens with zawame city ravaged by a fight between the heisei riders and the shōwa riders, before going back in time to the week before, when workers from the yggdrasill corporation are dragged by an unknown force to underground. upon hearing rumors about it, kota kazuraba investigates the area with his friend mai takatsukasa, just to fall into a hole as well and find themselves in an underground, alternate version of the city. the two find a boy called shu, who has the power to revert things and is certain that he has something important to do, but he does not remember what it is. kota and mai then bring the boy to the surface and takeshi hongo appears demanding them to hand him over, when soldiers from the underground badan empire appear to kidnap him as well and takeshi transforms into kamen rider one to allow kota, mai, and shu to escape. badan then launches an attack on the surface, and armored riders baron, ryugen, and zangetsu shin appear to fight back alongside kota, who transforms into armored rider gaim as well to protect his friends. however, gaim is attacked by kamen rider fifteen, who is also seeking the boy and also possesses a lockseed that allows him to transform into the rider arms of the 15 heisei riders, and when kamen riders one, two, and v3 appear to fight him, shu uses his powers to escape with gaim and mai. kota and mai take shu to drupers where they meet tsukasa kadoya, and narutaki appears before them as well, affirming that the fifteen heisei riders must join forces to stop the badan empire, and before leaving, warns them that asking for the shōwa riders help is useless as they will refuse to cooperate with them. tsukasa then departs to gather the other kamen riders with kaito kumon, while kota stays behind to take care of shu. the first rider they contact is shotaro hidari, who refuses to hear their plea before he finishes his job to search for some lost pets. leaving kaito behind to help shotaro with his errand, tsukasa contacts takumi inui who also refuses to help, claiming that his days as a kamen rider are over. kamen rider fifteen appears to attack them, and tsukasa transforms into kamen rider decade to fight him, allowing takumi and himself to escape harm. some time later in a ramen shop, takumi involves himself in an incident where a wounded runaway criminal holds mari, a high school girl, hostage. keisuke jin appears and heals his wounds before convincing him to release mari and surrender to the police. takumi then follows jin to his clinic, where he helps him tend to another patient. takumi then confides in jin about how he is haunted by the death of his friend masato kusaka and jin convinces him to stay at his clinic for a while. the next day, takumi and mari are attacked by the badan empire. in order to protect her, takumi decides to fight again as kamen rider faiz, defeating them, but in turn, jin reveals himself as kamen rider x, attacking and defeating faiz before claiming that he must find his resolve by himself. meanwhile, tsukasa finally convinces shotaro to listen to his request, and asks him about shu. elsewhere, shu finally remembers his past and leads kota to his house, where it is revealed that shu has been dead the whole time. just before his death, he had a fight with his mother, and he now wishes to see her one last time to make amends with her. kamen rider fifteen then appears to take shu with him, and kota learns that he is actually shu's father ren aoi. aoi reveals that the badan empire intends to use shu's powers to power up a machine known as the mega reverse, which can make the dead return to life while killing the living, allowing his son to come back to life. while kamen rider gaim fights kamen rider fifteen, kamen rider decade appears and takes shu to see his mother, but general jark stands on his way. kamen riders black and black rx appear to defeat jark before turning to fight kamen rider decade as well, but shotaro appears to fight them instead as kamen rider joker and allows tsukasa to keep escorting the boy. kamen rider baron appears to assist kamen rider joker against the shōwa riders while tsukasa takes shu to the lighthouse where his mother is staying. but before he can meet her, kamen rider fifteen appears and defeats both kamen riders decade and gaim with the power of the heisei rider lockseed. back in the present day, as the shōwa and heisei riders fight and defeat each other, general schwarz from the shadow line appears to join forces with the badan empire, interested in using the mega reverse machine to convert light into darkness to expand the shadow line's domains, and sends his kuliners to attack kamen rider den-o's den liner. kota, tsukasa, and takumi join forces with the remaining heisei riders and confront the shōwa riders about their reasons for attacking them. kamen rider one explains that it was all the heisei riders fault, as it was their attachment to their deceased important ones that empowered the badan empire and allowed the advent of kamen rider fifteen. meanwhile, ambassador darkness, the leader of the badan forces, reveals himself as ryo murasame, who has infiltrated the organization to destroy it from the inside. he betrays the generalissimo of badan, apparently destroying the mega reverse machine, but is deceived instead, when the true mega reverse machine is revealed to be the entire badan empire base, which takes flight up in the sky. ryo then reveals that the other kamen riders that have supposedly been defeated were in fact been sent to helheim forest, and takes the opportunity to summon them back all at once to assist him and kamen rider gaim. the heisei and shōwa riders confront the badan empire helped by armored riders baron, ryugen, and zangetsu shin when the generalissimo of badan reveals itself as a giant monster. daigo kiryu from the kyoryugers appears, as well, to fight the monster with gabutyra, but it proves itself too strong for just his zyudenryu. soon after, the toqgers and kamen rider den-o arrive to assist him, combining their trains with gabutyra into toq-oh kyoryuzin feat. denliner to destroy the generalissimo. as kamen rider decade rescues shu from the mega reverse machine, haruto soma and jin are about to destroy it for good, when they are stopped by takumi, who wants to atone for masato's death by allowing him to be revived. however, they convince him that destroying the machine is the right thing to do, and together the three destroy it together as kamen riders wizard, x and faiz. kamen rider one gives kamen rider gaim a special lockseed containing the powers of the 15 shōwa riders, allowing him to transform into one arms and finally defeat kamen rider fifteen, who returns to his senses. with the badan empire all but defeated, the shōwa riders use their power to have shu reunite and reconcile with his parents one last time before passing on to the other side. however, the shōwa riders are still in doubt if they can leave the protection of earth to the heisei riders and challenge them to a battle, with narutaki watching it all from afar. the battle concludes when kamen rider gaim risks himself to protect a single flower from kamen rider one's rider kick, leading the shōwa rider to admit defeat upon realizing his act of kindness. now truly reconciled, the shōwa and heisei riders then bid farewell to each other and follow their separate ways once more. in an alternate ending, kamen rider gaim admits defeat instead, as while he prepares a powered up attack to use against kamen rider one, he stops after realizing that the shōwa rider could attack him before he deploys it. kamen rider one still commends him upon realizing his act of kindness, leading the shōwa and heisei riders to reconcile as well. cast kamen rider series cast : : : , : : : : : : : : , : : /: : : super sentai series cast : : : : : : kamen

       " 'capital punishment in the republic of ireland was abolished in statute law in 1990, having been abolished in 1964 for most offences including ordinary murder. the last person to be executed by the british state in ireland was robert mcgladdery, who was hanged on 20 december 1961 in crumlin road gaol in belfast, northern ireland. the last person to be executed by the state in the republic of ireland was michael manning, hanged for murder on 20 april 1954. all subsequent death sentences in the republic of ireland, the last handed down in 1985, were commuted by the president, on the advice of the government, to terms of imprisonment of up to 40 years. the twenty-first amendment of the constitution, passed by referendum in 2001, prohibits the reintroduction of the death penalty, even during a state of emergency or war. capital punishment is also forbidden by several human rights treaties to which the state is a party. early history early irish law discouraged capital punishment. murder was usually punished with two types of fine: a fixed éraic and a variable log nenech; a murderer was only killed if he and his relatives could not pay the fine. the senchas már\\'\\'\\'s description of the execution of the murderer of saint patrick\\'s charioteer odran has been interpreted as a failed attempt to replace restorative justice with retributive justice. after the norman conquest of ireland, english law provided the model for irish law. this originally mandated a death sentence for any felony, a class of crimes established by common law but, in ireland as in england, was extended by various acts of parliament; a situation later dubbed the \"bloody code\". after the irish reformation, the protestant ascendancy to impede roman catholic practices passed penal laws, some of which created capital crimes which produced irish catholic martyrs. the gallows speech was a popular genre of broadside from the williamite revolution through the eighteenth century, feeding into popular ballads of the nineteenth century. in 1789 elizabeth sugrue (\"lady betty\") was among 26 led to the county roscommon gallows; when the hangman failed to appear, she agreed to hang the other 25 if the sheriff would stay her own execution. she remained county executioner until 1802, when her death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. most penal laws were repealed or disused by the late 18th century. as late as 1834 the officiant at an unlicensed catholic-protestant marriage was sentenced to death, albeit commuted to 18 months\\' imprisonment. the criminal law act 1827 allowed judges to sentence to transportation for many hitherto capital crimes. for more, peel\\'s acts in 1828 replaced the death penalty with penal servitude. the capital punishment (ireland) act 1842 brought the law in ireland closer to that of england by reducing the penalties for numerous offences, and abolishing the capital crime of serving in the army or navy of france. the offences against the person act 1861 reduced the number of capital crimes from over two hundred to just three: murder, treason and piracy with violence. death was a mandatory sentence for murder, though it was often commuted. the last public hanging in ireland was in 1868; after the capital punishment amendment act 1868 executions were carried out behind prison walls. irish doctor samuel haughton developed the humane \"standard drop\" method of hanging that came into use in 1866. the children act 1908 abolished the death penalty for a child or \"young person\" aged under 16. execution of irish republicans created political martyrs, such as the \"manchester martyrs\" of 1867. the prevention of crime (ireland) act, 1882, was enacted during the land war and introduced on the day of the funeral of lord frederick cavendish, one of the phoenix park murder victims. this encouraged non-jury trials to impose death sentences, prompting francis alexander fitzgerald to resign in protest as baron of the exchequer. in fact no death sentence was passed under the provisions of that act. revolutionary period in 1916, the execution of the leaders of the easter rising turned public sympathy in favour of the rebels. 24 rebels were executed during the 1919-21 war of independence, starting with kevin barry. in munster, which was under martial law, 13 were shot in cork and one in limerick. \"the forgotten ten\" were hanged in mountjoy prison, which helped turn opinion in dublin against the dublin castle administration. the last execution under british authority was of william mitchell, a black and tan convicted of the murder of a justice of the peace. the forces of the irish republic proclaimed in 1916, which fought the 1919-21 war against the british authorities, established its own republican courts. in summer 1920, when a county meath republican court sentenced a man to death for murder, the sentence was referred to the dáil ministry, which decided to uphold it, although constance markievicz was reluctant. the irish republican army was empowered by the first dáil to court-martial and execute pro-unionist civilians for such crimes as \"spying\" and collaboration. the procedures at such trials depended on the local ira leadership; many were kangaroo courts imposing summary justice. besides executions, ira members also carried out combat operations, assassinations, extrajudicial killings, and personally motivated murders, with varying levels of sanction from the republican leadership; historians have commented that the dividing lines between these categories can be blurred and contentious; an example being the 1922 dunmanway killings. the 1922 committee drafting the constitution of the irish free state submitted three drafts, of which draft b explicitly prohibited the death penalty; the provisional government\\'s final draft was based on draft b but deleted this prohibition. british laws prescribing the death penalty thus continued in force. the death penalty was retained because of the outbreak of the 1922-3 civil war. as well as the existing british laws, the \"special powers act\" (adopted in the form of a motion rather than an act of parliament) was passed by the third dáil on 26 september 1922 authorising the national army to establish military tribunals and impose death sentences for anti-treaty activity.; the national army made such regulations on 2 october 1922, revised 8-17 january 1923. in the course of the civil war there were 81 executions by firing squad under these military tribunals. there were also extrajudicial killings, with varying levels of government complicity. in the first decades of the new state\\'s existence, many petitions asking cabinet ministers to commute death sentences adverted to the fact that many ministers had themselves been under sentence of death by either the british or the irish free state during the revolutionary period. later executions between november 1923 and april 1954, there were a total of 35 executions within the republic of ireland. 55 men and women were also sentenced to death in that time period but ultimately received a reprieve. thirteen were sentenced for murdering their newborns, and 42 for other types of murder. in the 1920s, execution was relatively common for murderers. the only woman executed after independence was annie walsh in 1925. she and her nephew blamed each other for the murder of her elderly husband. the press expected only the nephew to be found guilty, but both were. she was hanged aged 31 in spite of the jury recommending clemency. in the absence of a local executioner, the irish government retained the pre-independence custom of having a british hangman come to mountjoy prison to perform executions. a resident irishman, alias \"thomas johnston\", applied to mountjoy in 1941, and in 1945, after two days\\' training from albert pierrepoint at strangeways, assisted pierrepoint hanging james lehman. hired as sole hangman for joseph mcmanus in 1947, johnston nervously ceded to pierrepoint and never served again. increased ira activity during the state of emergency in world war ii led to six executions. five were shot by firing squad after sentence by military tribunals under the emergency powers act 1939. of these, maurice o\\'neill and richard goss had shot but not killed gardaí: the only people executed by the state for a non-murder crime. charlie kerins, the ira chief of staff, executed for murdering a garda, was hanged rather than shot, making the point of treating him as a common criminal rather than a political prisoner. pierrepoint\\'s autobiography claimed the ira had ambitions to kidnap him while he was en route to kerins. harry gleeson, hanged in 1941 for the 1940 murder of moll mccarthy, was granted a posthumous pardon in 2015. seán macbride was gleeson\\'s defence counsel and attributed his later opposition to the death penalty to his belief in gleeson\\'s innocence. michael manning was the last person executed in the republic of ireland, while robert mcgladdery was the last person executed in all of ireland. manning was hanged for murder by albert pierrepoint on 20 april 1954. the same year, brendan behan\\'s play the quare fellow premiered, in which the title character was modelled on bernard kirwan, awaiting execution in mountjoy while behan was imprisoned there. legal developments the 1922 \"special powers act\" was replaced after the civil war by a series of public safety acts promoted by cumann na ngaedheal governments to counter residual republican paramilitary activity. the 1923 act, valid for six months, allowed the death penalty for \"armed revolt against the government of saorstát eireann [the irish free state]\", whereas the 1924 act, valid for one year, reduced this to life imprisonment. the treasonable offences act, 1925 defined such offences as treason punishable by death. the court officers act 1926 phased out the office of under-sheriff and transferred responsibility for executions to the governor of the relevant prison; always mountjoy prison in practice. the public safety act 1927, passed in response to the assassination of kevin o\\'higgins, provided for a special military tribunal during a state of emergency, required the tribunal to pass death sentences for treason and murder, and permitted it to do so for unlawful possession of firearms; no appeal would be permitted. the act was originally to last five years, but was expired at the end of 1928. in 1931, eoin o\\'duffy used the threat posed by saor éire to press for a new public safety act, the constitution (amendment no. 17) act 1931.constitution (amendment no. 17) act, 1931 irish statute book this empowered the tribunal to try a variety of crimes and impose a greater sentence than usual, including death, if \"in the opinion of the tribunal such greater punishment is necessary or expedient\". this provision was condemned by the fianna fáil opposition (which came to power following the 1932 general election) and was never invoked. the tribunal\\'s sole death sentence was for murder, handed down in 1936 and commuted to life imprisonment. fianna fáil introduced a new constitution in 1937, which contained several references to execution: article 13 section 6 the right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are hereby vested in the president, but such power of commutation or remission may, except in capital cases, also be conferred by law on other authorities. article 40 section 4 subsection 5 where an order is made under this section by the high court or a judge thereof for the production of the body of a person who is under sentence of death, the high court or such judge thereof shall further order that the execution of the said sentence of death shall be deferred until after the body of such person has been produced before the high court and the lawfulness of his detention has been determined and if, after such deferment, the detention of such person is determined to be lawful, the high court shall appoint a day for the execution of the said sentence of death and that sentence shall have effect with the substitution of the day so appointed for the day originally fixed for the execution thereof. subsection 6 nothing in this section, however, shall be invoked to prohibit, control, or interfere with any act of the defence forces during the existence of a state of war or armed rebellion. article 39 of the constitution narrowed the definition of treason, and the treason act 1939 retained the death penalty for the redefined offence. the military court operating during the emergency of the second world war was required to impose a sentence of \"death by shooting\", from which there was no appeal, although commutation was possible. the crimes in its remit were: committing, \"attempting or conspiring to commit, or aiding, abetting counselling or procuring the commission\" of the following:— treason; murder; wounding while resisting arrest; unlawful imprisonment; causing an explosion; unlawful possession of explosives, firearms, or ammunition; damaging equipment of the defence forces or \"essential services\"; and \"obtaining, recording, or communicating in any manner likely to prejudice the public safety or the preservation of the state of any information directly or indirectly prejudicial to the state\". the children act 1941 raised the minimum age for execution from 16 to 17. a committee appointed \"to consider and report on the law and practice relating to capital punishment\" reported in 1941. it comprised four judges with experience of murder trials, chaired by the chief justice, timothy sullivan. the committee was precluded from considering abolition of the death penalty. it said the law was generally unproblematic, but recommended changes to the insanity defence and also making infanticide a separate crime from murder. the latter was effected by the infanticide act 1949. since independence, all 13 death sentences for murder in such cases had been commuted. seán mac eoin, the minister for justice, said the new act was intended \"to eliminate all the terrible ritual of the black cap and the solemn words of the judge pronouncing sentence of death in those cases ... where it is clear to the court and to everybody, except perhaps the unfortunate accused, that the sentence will never be carried out.\" even before 1949, most infanticides were convicted of manslaughter or concealment of birth rather than murder; conversely, a murder charge was still possible after 1949 (as in the 1984 kerry babies case). the criminal justice act 1951, in conformance with article 13.6 of the constitution, explicitly excluded capital cases from those to which the government was granted the power to commute sentences. the geneva conventions act 1962 permitted, but did not require, death sentences for \"grave breaches\" of the 1949 geneva conventions involving \"wilful killing\". successive ministers for justice were asked in the dáil about abolishing the death penalty: in 1936 by frank macdermot; in 1939 by jeremiah hurley; in 1948 by james larkin jnr and peadar cowan; in 1956 by thomas finlay; in 1960 by frank sherwin; in 1962 by stephen coughlan. in each case the relevant minister dismissed the suggestion. seán macbride expressed personal support for abolition even while a minister in a government that oversaw the 1948 execution of william m. gambon. in 1951-52, macbride\\'s dáil motion that a select committee consider whether to abolish the death penalty was defeated by 63 votes to 23. in 1956, the seanad passed a motion \"that in the opinion of seanad eireann the government should consider the question of introducing legislation to abolish capital punishment or to suspend it for an experimental period\". criminal justice act 1964 when seán brady asked in february 1963, minister charles haughey announced \"that the death penalty for murder generally will be abolished but it will be retained for certain specific types of murder.\" in 1984 haughey said, \"very shortly after becoming minister for justice, i went up to mountjoy to see the condemned cell and i was so revolted by the whole atmosphere that i resolved to do away with the death penalty.\" the criminal justice act 1964 abolished the death penalty for piracy with violence, some military crimes, geneva conventions breaches, and most murders. it continued to be available for: treason offences under military law, relating to neglect of command assisting the enemy passivity as a prisoner of war mutiny \"capital murder\", i.e. of a garda or prison officer \"acting in the course of his duty\"; or for a political motive, of a foreign head of state, diplomat, or government member; or in the course or furtherance of certain offences under the offences against the state act 1939: usurpation of functions of government (irish republican legitimists believed the ira army council was the legitimate government of ireland) obstruction of government (legislative, judicial, or executive branches) obstruction of the president interference with military or other employees of the state furtherance of the aims of an organisation which is unlawful for reasons other than tax resistance (this applied to the irish republican army and irish national liberation army) the list of actions constituting \"capital murder\" was somewhat different from those in the uk\\'s homicide act 1957. the extradition act, 1965 prevented extradition where the prisoner could be sentenced to death for a crime not punishable by death in ireland. the meaning of \"capital murder\" under the 1964 act was elucidated by the supreme court in the 1977 case of noel and marie murray, convicted of capital murder after the 1975 shooting of a garda, who was off duty and not in uniform, giving chase after they had robbed a bank. the court held that \"capital murder\" was a new offence, not merely a subtype of the existing common-law offence of murder; and that the garda was acting \"in the course of his duty\", despite not being on duty; but that, as he was in plain clothes, the murrays did not know he was a garda; and so, while there was intent (mens rea\\'\\') to commit murder, there was no intent to commit capital murder. commuted death sentences from 1923 to 1964, 40 death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment; three condemned were found insane, and three died awaiting execution. criminology professor ian o\\'donnell wrote in 2016 that murderers with commuted death sentences \"were released after periods of time that would be considered absurdly short today\". in the years 1946-62, 82 murders produced 73 arrests; of these 34 were unfit to plead because of insanity, 7 found guilty but insane, and 18 found guilty and thus mandatorily sentenced to death. the sentences were executed on 3 and commuted on the other 15, including all three women. mamie cadden was sentenced to be hanged in 1957 for felony murder after performing an illegal abortion on a woman who died. death sentences were passed on 11 people after the 1964 act, for 5 different incidents involving the capital murder of a total of 6 gardaí (police). all were imposed by the special criminal court. the murders of several other gardaí, and of british ambassador christopher ewart-biggs in 1976, might also have constituted capital crimes had any prosecution been brought. of the 11 sentenced to death, 2 had the conviction for capital murder quashed on appeal, and were convicted instead of ordinary murder. the death sentences of the other 9 were commuted by the president on the advice of the government, to 40 years\\' imprisonment without parole. one conviction was overturned in 1995. the 40-year sentences were controversial, both because they had no statutory basis, and because they were not handed down by a judge. the court of criminal appeal has upheld the sentences as the extrajudicial procedure is in step with the irish constitution\\'s provision for commuting sentences. four convicts were released in 1998 under the amnesty of political prisoners under the good friday agreement. the remaining four protested that they were also eligible for the amnesty, but were not released under its provisions. the state refused to grant the standard remission of sentences due for good behaviour, which would make them eligible for parole after 30 years. one of the four, noel callan, took a court case that he was entitled to remission, which was rejected by the high court in 2011, but upheld by the supreme court in 2013. two of the four, who had already served over thirty years, were released straight away, while callan and the fourth were released in december 2015 upon reaching 30 years. abolition paschal robinson, the papal nuncio to ireland from 1930 to 1948, reportedly favoured a trial suspension of capital punishment. in 1937 rosamond jacob and john henry webb established the society for the abolition of the death penalty, which unsuccessfully lobbied that the treason act 1939 abolish the death penalty for treason. noel browne introduced a private member\\'s bill to abolish the death penalty in the republic of ireland in march 1981. the fianna fáil government voted it down on its first reading. fine gael had supported the first reading and would have allowed a free vote at the second reading; the labour party supported abolition. the troubles were then ongoing, and the minister for justice, gerry collins, in opposing the bill, referred to the four death sentences which were then pending appeal, and said \"were we to abolish [the death penalty], and because of the violence of recent years, the pressure for arming the garda would become extremely strong\". david doyle comments that the implication that capital punishment was a deterrent to physical force irish republicanism was \"particularly peculiar\" in light of the 1981 hunger strikes, in which ten republican prisoners chose to die. after the general election in june 1981, the fine gael-labour coalition introduced a bill in the seanad to abolish the death penalty for treason and capital murder, which passed there but had not reached the dáil when the government fell in january 1982. independent senators introduced an identical bill, which began its second reading in 1985 but lapsed at the 1987 dissolution. the fine gael-labour coalition was also drafting an abolition bill at the time. a 1986 department of foreign affairs briefing made public in 2017 said: independent senators reintroduced abolition bills in 1987 and again after the 1989 election. in 1988, the progressive democrats (pds) produced an aspirational \"constitution for a new republic\", which included a prohibition on capital punishment. the republic of ireland\\'s 1989 ratification of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr), effective 8 march 1990, made a reservation to article 6(5). the article reads \"sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age and shall not be carried out on pregnant women.\" the irish government\\'s declaration read \"pending the introduction of further legislation to give full effect to the provisions of paragraph 5 of article 6, should a case arise which is not covered by the provisions of existing law, the government of ireland will have regard to its obligations under the covenant in the exercise of its power to advise commutation of the sentence of death.\" the legislation referred to was the child care bill 1988, which became law in 1991; a section was to have been included to raise from 17 to 18 the minimum age for the death penalty. in may 1989, fianna fáil minister michael woods stated: after the june 1989 general election, fianna fáil formed a coalition with the pds; the agreed programme for government included abolishing the death penalty in the republic of ireland. despite opposition from garda representative organisations, the death penalty was abolished for all offences by the criminal justice act 1990, which made life imprisonment the penalty for what had been capital crimes, and all except the military crimes had a minimum term of not less than forty years; remission rules are stricter than for other crimes. the child care bill 1988 was still pending, so the section relating to the death penalty was removed as superfluous. although media sometimes still use the term \"capital murder\", the legal term is now \"murder to which section 3 of the criminal justice act 1990 applies\". in 1993, the then tánaiste, dick spring, said in vienna that the 1990 abolition should be made irreversible, which taoiseach albert reynolds later confirmed was government policy and would involve a constitutional amendment. however, the government fell six months later. one recommendation of the 1996 constitutional review group was: article 40.4.5° prescribed the treatment of those under sentence of death; article 28.3.3° deals with the suspension of rights during a state of emergency. on 7 june 2001, the twenty-first amendment of the constitution of ireland was one of three proposed amendments put to referendums. it added article 15.5.2°, which prohibits the death penalty; deleted as redundant article 40.4.5° and several other references to \"capital crimes\"; and amended article 28.3.3° to prevent the death penalty being imposed during an emergency. the referendum commission produced an information booklet, with arguments for and against the amendment derived from submissions it had solicited from the public. the amendment was passed on a turnout of 34.79%, with 610,455 in favour and 372,950 against. the 38% no-vote was higher than the 28% predicted by polls; there were suggestions that the wording of the ballot question was confusing and that some voters were expressing dissatisfaction with the government. the republic of ireland adopted the second optional protocol to the iccpr in 1993, and the sixth protocol to the european convention on human rights (echr) in 1994, both of which prohibit the death penalty in peacetime. the reservation to iccpr article 6(5) was withdrawn in 1994. ireland ratified the thirteenth protocol to the echr, which prohibits the death penalty in wartime, at its opening in 2002. as a member of the european union (eu), ireland is subject to the eu charter of fundamental rights, an extension of the echr proclaimed in 2000 which became eu law in 2009. debate a 2000 opinion poll in 59 countries ranked ireland third lowest in support for reintroducing the death penalty. doyle and o\\'callaghan comment: \"this does not imply widespread active popular opposition to the death penalty in ireland, but there was, at least, a great deal of indifference to it and very little desire to see it ever reintroduced\". the media occasionally reports calls to reconsider the ban on capital punishment. in november 2009, richard johnson, recently retired as president of the high court, said that he favoured reintroduction of the death penalty in limited circumstances, such as murder committed during armed robberies. the irish council for civil liberties described his remarks as \"deeply misguided and frivolous\". at the january 2010 meeting of the mid-west regional authority, two members of clare county council called for \"a public debate\" on the death penalty. in june 2010, after several gang-related murders in limerick, outgoing mayor kevin kiely advocated the death penalty for \"anyone involved in the planning and premeditation of a murder\". the national party, a right-wing group established in 2016, supports reintroduction of the death penalty for \"particularly heinous crimes\". kevin sharkey, seeking to run in the 2018 irish presidential election, supported the death penalty for home invasions on the elderly. see also prisoners sentenced to death by ireland, includes those executed black cap references footnotes sources citations external links lists of all those executed, from \"capital punishment u.k.\" site: irish executions 1835 - 1899 20th century executions in the irish republic (eire) executions in northern ireland in the 20th century tag:\"death penalty\", archive of rté news broadcasts penal system in the republic of ireland ireland irish criminal law death in the republic of ireland human rights abuses in ireland 1990 disestablishments in ireland',\n",

       " 'orrin teall maxson (march 17, 1823may 12, 1895) was an american physician, politician, and wisconsin pioneer. he was an important early settler of prescott, wisconsin, and represented northwestern wisconsin in the wisconsin state assembly during the 1853 and 1857 legislative sessions. his name was often abbreviated ; his last name was sometimes spelled maxon. early life orrin t. maxson was born march 17, 1823, in centerville, new york, where his father was a pioneer settler. he was raised and educated in centerville. during these formative years, his father and older brother, arthur, went to the wisconsin territory in 1837 and became some of the first settlers at what is now darien, wisconsin. they also established the first sawmill there in 1841. orrin attended rush medical college in chicago and graduated in the class of 1849. after his time in medical school he went west for a year and helped establish a hospital in colorado. prescott settlement and political career after a year in colorado, maxson came back to wisconsin to the site of what is now prescott, wisconsin. that site had first been settled by philander prescott in 1841, but had languished due to land disputes with the federal government and the influential american fur company. maxson was one of the pioneers who finally broke this impasse, buying out some of the original fur trading interests and establishing the first store in 1851. in 1852 and 1853, maxson went about purchasing much of the land which is now prescott, wisconsin, in partnership with william j. copp. they had the site platted and surveyed and actively promoted the growth of the settlement, and maxson operated a medical practice there for the next fifteen years. maxson was appointed the first postmaster at prescott in 1852. the first school district in the area was also organized in 1852, and maxson was elected the first clerk of the school district in the fall of 1852. that same fall, maxson was elected to the wisconsin state assembly, running on the democratic party ticket. he represented the vast northwest district, stretching along the border and coast from what is now pierce county in the south to what is now ashland county in the north. pierce county was first organized in 1853, and that fall maxson was selected as the first justice of the peace. after the creation of the republican party in 1854, maxson became a member of the new party. through the 1850s, maxson was identified with a group of republican men in prescott referred to as the \"waukegan clique\", including austin h. young. maxson most likely met some of them while attending college in illinois. he next ran for state office in 1856 and was elected to another term in the wisconsin state assembly. his district this time stretched from pierce county into the core of the northwest quadrant of wisconsin, including the areas that are now clark, chippewa, eau claire, dunn, pepin, rusk, and price counties. following the 1857 legislative session, maxson was appointed to the first board of regents of the wisconsin normal school, serving until 1861. during these years, he also became involved in the movement establishing agricultural societies, becoming one of the founders of the pierce county agricultural society and an officer in the state agricultural society. civil war service at the outbreak of the american civil war, maxson assisted in raising a company of volunteers for the union army and was chosen as first lieutenant of that company. his company was enrolled as company a in the 12th wisconsin infantry regiment. they mustered into federal service in january 1862 and went south for service in the western theater of the war. they had a difficult time moving through illinois due to problems with the railroad and insufficient winter lodgings, but eventually arrived at weston, missouri. there, maxson\\'s company\\'s captain, norman mcleod, resigned, and maxson was promoted to captain of the company. he would lead the company for the next two years of the war. after several months in kansas, they were moved to kentucky and tennessee, where they repaired and secured railroads and hunted guerillas. they arrived at corinth after the second battle of corinth, and then joined grant\\'s vicksburg campaign, and were invested in the siege of vicksburg up to its surrender in july 1863. afterward, they were involved in pacifying remaining confederate resistance in southern mississippi and louisiana until they received a veterans\\' furlough in march 1864. returning from their furlough in wisconsin, they met the non-veteran members of the regiment and then joined sherman\\'s atlanta campaign, meeting the army of the tennessee at acworth, georgia, in june. shortly after arriving, they participated in preliminary actions leading toward the battle of kennesaw mountain, at which maxson distinguished himself. at the time, the union and confederate lines were entrenched about 1,000 yards apart. after a massing of confederate forces was noticed in a nearby wooded area, maxson was appointed to lead a small force of volunteers from the 12th wisconsin infantry to ascertain the disposition of this confederate force. after crossing the field, they navigated through the wood and found himself on the flank of a confederate rifle pit, and poured on enfilading fire into the trench. the confederates fled back to their reserve lines until reinforced by a brigade, which exchanged fire with maxson\\'s detachment, which soon withdrew in good order. maxson received compliments from his brigade, division, and corps commanders, including general james b. mcpherson. maxson\\'s commander, george e. bryant, then serving as brigade commander, wrote of maxson\\'s reconnaissance in his official report on the events leading up to the capture of atlanta. in early july, maxson again played a leading role in skirmishing around the nickajack creek. maxson led a rapid advancing skirmishing line which forced confederates to abandon trenches and flee to the other side of the river. after securing the river, a few days later they led the advance across the river along with the 16th wisconsin infantry regiment. they came under intense fire in open field, but charged directly into a confederate trench, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. the 12th regiment had been reduced to 600 combat-ready men before the start of this charge and lost another 134 in the attack, but captured the line along with hundreds of confederate firearms. the next day, the confederates attempted a strong counterattack which captured a number of positions along the line. the 12th wisconsin infantry held a critical angle on the line against the confederate counterattack and poured on devastating fire until other union forces were able to move up to the confederate flank. they were then engaged in the trench lines until the capture of atlanta. shortly after the fall of atlanta, maxson\\'s three-year enlistment expired and he returned to wisconsin. later years after the war, maxson joined in the effort to try to establish an industrial school in wisconsin. in the late 1860s, he moved to waukegan, illinois, where he resumed his medical practice. he remained there until 1883, when he moved his practice to the village of south evanston, illinois. he was active again in local government before and after south evanston was annexed into evanston. in the 1890s, maxson\\'s health began to decline and he was forced to give up his medical practice. he moved west to pasadena, california, hoping the climate would improve his health. he often took morphine to address pain, and on may 12, 1895, he overdosed on morphine and died at his home in pasadena. personal life and family orrin maxson was the sixth of seven children born to and his wife amelia ( ward). joseph maxson was born in rhode island but left home at age 17. with just two cents to his name, he bartered his shoes in exchange for an axe and used the axe to clear a farm for himself in allegany county, new york. his farm would become the first settlement in what is now centerville, new york. in 1837, he became a pioneer again, when he was one of the first settlers at what is now darien, wisconsin. the maxsons were descended from the colonist richard maxson, who came to the massachusetts bay colony from england in the early 1630s. orrin\\'s younger sister, caroline, married joseph w. beardsley, another pioneer of prescott, wisconsin. densmore maxon, who was also a prominent wisconsin politician

       " \"the 6th panzer division () was an armoured division in the german army, the heer, during world war ii, established in october 1939. the division, initially formed as a light brigade, participated in the invasions of poland, belgium, france and the soviet union. from 1941 to 1945 it fought on the eastern front, interrupted only by periods of refitting spent in france and germany. it eventually surrendered to us forces in czechoslovakia in may 1945 but was handed over to soviet authorities, where the majority of its remaining men would be imprisoned in gulag hard labour camps. history the 1st light brigade was a mechanized unit established in october 1937 in imitation of the french division légère mécanique. it was intended to take on the roles of army-level reconnaissance and security that had traditionally been the responsibility of cavalry. it included mechanized reconnaissance units, motorized infantry, and a battalion of tanks. the concept of the light brigade, of which three were planned by the wehrmacht, quickly showed its flawed nature and was abandoned. in april 1938 the brigade was enlarged to become the 1st light division, receiving the 11th tank regiment as an attachment for its participation in the occupation of the sudetenland in october 1938 and the subsequent disestablishment of czechoslovakia in march 1939. following the latter the division received 130 czech-built tanks which were superior to the panzer i and panzer ii the division had been equipped with. in 1939, the division fought in the invasion of poland. due to shortcomings that the campaign revealed in the organization of the light divisions, it was reorganized as the 6th panzer division in october 1939, as were the other three light divisions which became the 7th, 8th and 9th panzer divisions. as the 6th panzer division, it participated in the 1940 battle of france. the division contained a single panzer regiment, the panzer-regiment 11, which in turn contained three abteilungen, or battalions. the 11th regiment was equipped with 75 czech-built panzer 35(t) tanks, which proved efficient but difficult to maintain because the maintenance manuals were in czech rather than german, and spare parts were less readily supplied and harder to easily requisition as a result. furthermore, there were six befehlspanzer 35(t), which were a subtype of the 35(t) designed for military commanders, as well as 45 panzer ii and 27 panzer iv. the division was part of the german advance to the english channel through belgium. it then swung back towards the french-swiss border before relocating to eastern prussia in september 1940 where it remained until june 1941. at the time of the german invasion of the soviet union the division had 239 tanks, but only twelve of those were panzer iii, which still struggled to pierce the armour of soviet tanks such as the t-34 and kv-1. in june 1941, it joined operation barbarossa, fighting at first under army group north for leningrad. at the battle of raseiniai two of its kampfgruppes consisted of: kampfgruppe von seckendorff consisting of the 114th motorized infantry regiment, panzer reconnaissance battalion 57, one company of panzerjäger battalion 41 and motorcycle battalion 6 (morning). kampfgruppe raus consisted of panzer regiment 11, one battalion of the 4th motorized infantry regiment, the 1st and 3rd battalions of the 76th artillery regiment, one company of panzer engineer battalion 57, one company from panzerjäger battalion 41, one battery of the 2nd battalion flak regiment 411 and motorcycle battalion 6 (afternoon). on 23 june, kampfgruppe von seckendorff of the division, with, for that morning only, motorcycle battalion 6, was overrun by gen. yegor solyankin's 2nd tank division from the 3rd mechanised corps near skaudvilė. the german panzer 35(t) tanks and infantry anti-tank weapons were ineffective against the soviet heavy tanks—some of them were out of ammunition but closed in and destroyed german antitank guns by driving over them. the germans concentrated on immobilising the soviet tanks by firing at their tracks and then by tackling them with artillery, anti-aircraft guns, or by blowing them up with explosive charges of the sticky bomb type, or swarming with infantry to force grenades down the tank hatches. 6th panzer division was soon transferred to army group center, where it fought in the battle of moscow and the rzhev-vyazma salient. with the soviet counter offensive in december 1941 the division was pushed back and suffered the loss of practically all its tanks and most of its vehicles. with losses severe enough to render it combat incapable, the 6th panzer division was sent to france to be rebuilt in march 1942 and equipped with more modern tanks. it was moved to southern france after the allied landings in north africa in november 1942 - operation torch - but soon after relocated to the southern sector of the eastern front after the german 6th army had been entrapped at stalingrad. operation winter storm the 6th panzer division along with the 23rd panzer division former the lvii panzer corps of general friedrich kirchner which was the southern pincer of operation winter storm. ultimately, failed german attempt to break through to the encircled forces but then had to retreat to escape encirclement itself. the division was part of the german retreat and successful counter offensive at kharkov and the failed attempt to regain initiative in the battle of kursk. the 6th panzer division was part of the partially successful relief operation at the korsun-cherkassy pocket as well as the escape from the kamenets-podolsky pocket. after the retreat through the ukraine the division was sent to germany for reorganisation but hastily returned to the eastern front in july, after the destruction of army group center in the soviet operation bagration. it was part of the german defence of northern poland and east prussia before being relocated to hungary in december 1944. it took part in the battles around siege of budapest before retreating into austria and taking part in the defence of vienna. when the city fell it moved into czechoslovakia where it surrendered to us 3rd army in may 1945 but was handed over to soviet forces. war crimes soldiers of the division allegedly executed an unknown number of black prisoners of war from the 12th senegalese tirailleurs regiment in mid-june 1940. it is estimated that, of the 40,000 black soldiers from the french colonies engaged in combat with german forces during the battle of france 1,500 to 3,000 died either during or after combat. commanders the commanders of the division: generalleutnant erich hoepner (10 november 1938 -
